This sleek, black-bladed dagger hums with restrained malice. The hilt is bound in sea-worn leather, and the curved blade bears a spiraling etching that resembles a mollusk’s tongue or a serpent’s fang. When a Warlock channels their Patron's pact through it, inky venom beads at the tip like sweat from a lie.
