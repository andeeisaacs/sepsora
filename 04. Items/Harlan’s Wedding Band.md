## **Harlan’s Wedding Band**

_Wondrous Item, unique, uncommon_  
_Attunement not required_

> A simple, brushed bronze band, worn smooth by decades of use. The interior bears a delicate Elvish inscription:  
> _“Through quiet days and storm-lit nights — M.”_

- **Use While Separated:**
    
    - When within 10 miles of Mira’s matching band, this ring functions as a **one-way Sending Stone**. Once per day, the wearer may speak a single 25-word message, which is heard directly in the mind of the bearer of Mira’s ring.
        
    - This feature resets at dawn.
        
- **Other Notes:**
    
    - Emotionally reactive—warm to the touch when Mira is in danger (GM discretion).
        
    - If brought near Mira’s ring and both are willingly worn or held together, the latent enchantment awakens.
