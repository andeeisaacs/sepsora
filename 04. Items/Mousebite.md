This rugged, compact hand crossbow looks hand-built—scrap brass bolted to dark walnut wood, the stock carved from an old butter churn handle. Small etched mouse tracks run along the grip, and the loading chamber has been replaced by a curious glowing crystal. Despite its scrappy appearance, ***Mousebite*** fires cleanly with a quiet *snap* and conjures its own bolts made of faint golden force.

Traits:
- **+1 bonus** to attack & damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- The weapon **automatically generates its own bolts** of magical force when fired. It never requires ammunition.
- The weapon **ignores the loading property**.
