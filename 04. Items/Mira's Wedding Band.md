## **Mira’s Wedding Band**

_Wondrous Item, unique, uncommon_  
_Attunement not required_

> Slightly more refined than its pair, Mira’s ring is a soft-gold alloy etched with a similar Elvish phrase:  
> _“Through storm-lit nights and quiet days — H.”_

- **Use While Separated:**
    
    - When within 10 miles of Harlan’s ring, it functions as a **one-way Sending Stone** (receiver only).
        
    - The wearer instinctively knows if the last message was sent in fear, pain, or peace (GM discretion—emotion, not content).
        
- **Other Notes:**
    
    - Emits a soft metallic vibration when the wearer is within 300 feet of Harlan’s ring.
