## **Stormbound Bands**

_Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)_  
_Only activates when both rings are attuned and willingly worn by the same creature_

> Reunited at last, these bands resonate with the weight of a bond forged through hardship and held through loss. The magic that awakens is subtle, steady, and fiercely protective.

### While Attuned:

- **Emotional Anchor:** The wearer gains resistance to **psychic damage**.
    
- **Ward of Devotion:** Once per long rest, as a reaction, the wearer may grant another creature within 30 feet advantage on a saving throw. This is flavored as an instinctive surge of protective emotion.
    
- **Echoing Bond:** Once per long rest, the wearer may cast _sending_ without material components, flavored as the rings transmitting deep memory or presence.
    

### Additional Flavors:

- When activated, the bands emit a faint shimmer like heat rising off stone after rain.
    
- Dreams experienced while wearing both rings often replay Mira and Harlan’s memories—but distorted or incomplete, like someone else remembering them from far away.
