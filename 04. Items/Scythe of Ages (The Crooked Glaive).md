### **Weapon Type**  
This weapon is treated as a glaive mechanically (reach, two-handed, etc.) but manifests as a golden-white scythe with a blade of curved starlight. Runes drift lazily along its haft, and its shadow ticks like a clock hand.

---

### **Stats**  
- You gain a **+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls** with this magic weapon.  
- **Counts as a Pact Weapon** for Warlocks and a valid **Divine Channeling focus** for Clerics.  
- While attuned, your **proficiency bonus is doubled** for Initiative rolls.

---

### **Features**

**Harvest Time (1/turn).**  
When you hit a creature with this weapon, you may declare it to be the “appointed moment.” That creature must succeed on a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or:
- Be **slowed** until the end of its next turn (*as the spell*, no concentration required).  
- Lose **reaction capabilities** until the end of your next turn.

If the creature is affected by *Hex*, *Bestow Curse*, or *Mark of Fate* (see below), the save is made with **disadvantage**.

---

**Mark of Fate (2/day).**  
As a bonus action, you may designate a creature you can see within 60 ft. for fate’s harvest. For the next minute:
- Your melee weapon attacks against that creature **deal an additional 1d12 force damage**.  
- Once per turn, when the marked creature **uses a legendary resistance**, you regain 1 expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower.  

The effect ends early if you fall unconscious or mark a new target.

---

**Chrono-Reap (1/day).**  
When you reduce a creature to 0 HP with this weapon, you may immediately choose one of the following:

- **Steal Time.** Gain an additional **action** on your next turn.  
- **Lock Time.** Choose one creature you can see; they must succeed a **DC 18 Charisma saving throw** or become **stunned until the end of your next turn**.  
- **Preserve the Instant.** Choose a moment (a buff, a location, a condition) and preserve it as a reaction for the next round. You may **replay** that moment as an effect on yourself or another creature, once.

---

### **Thematic Perks**

- While attuned to the Scythe of Ages, your **footsteps leave behind faded afterimages** of yourself for a few seconds.
- **You do not age**, and your appearance becomes subtly preserved in a perfect state, like a living portrait.
- You can **read, speak, and write Celestial** and **Primordial**.
- Once per long rest, you may ask the Scythe a **yes/no question about the future** (functions as *Augury*, with added DM flavor).

---

### **Optional Sentience (Neutral)**  
The Scythe of Ages is sentient, aligned with **Lawful Neutral**, and speaks in a clockwork, emotionless tone.

- **Intelligence** 16 | **Wisdom** 18 | **Charisma** 14  
- It values **order**, **fate**, and **purpose**.  
- The Scythe may **refuse to function** if its wielder acts purely out of chaos or impulse.
