Coral-Fused Buckler of the Tidewatch
 *Wondrous Item (shield), uncommon (requires proficiency with shields)*

**Weight**: 6 lbs
**Cost**: 350 GP
**Shape**: Round

Forged of weathered driftwood and rimmed with living coral, this small, ocean-worn buckler carries the scent of salt spray and old secrets. Seafoam patterns curl through the silver inlay across its face, and when danger stirs nearby, the coral stiffens like reef-spines sensing blood in water.

While wielding this shield:

- **AC Bonus.** You gain a +2 bonus to AC.
- **Vigilant Watch.** You have advantage on **Wisdom** (**Perception**) checks made to detect hidden or approaching creatures within 30 feet.
- **Tidewatch Rebuke (1/long rest).** When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose **disadvantage** on that roll. Saltwater vapor coils outward, momentarily veiling you in briny mist.

**Notes:**
- This shield requires no attunement.
- The coral along its rim occasionally weeps seawater during moments of high tension or danger.
