- Thin vine-bound leather covered field journal:
	    - First several pages note various mundane hunting life over the last season
	    - Some notation of the forest seeming to smell stranger than normal, 
	    - a mention of wanting to explore the Star Mounts,
	    - A few pages regarding bringing shipment of goods to M&H for Holt. 
	    -  Discovery of a passage leading down to the Underdark. 
	    -  Outlining reports of strange occurrences. Farm animals having broken free and fleeing the farm. Most particular and documented is a final page explaining how a  Drow came to town, eyes pulsing, was first seen standing in the middle of the road in broad daylight (very odd). No weapons on him. Despite the Drow wearing typical lolth militarian garb, he did not show hostility and was mostly docile. Out of fear of it being a scout, though, they kept him in the barn. 
	    - Last entry was a day before Calen's regular shipment to B&H. 
	    
      If rolled higher: The back cover of the journal has a false lining, a thread hanging where if tugged, the lining off to reveal a boon/bane card.
