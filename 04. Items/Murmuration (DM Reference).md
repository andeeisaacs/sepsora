## **Murmuration – DM Reference**

_Sentient Weapon (scimitar), uncommon – scaling with Warlock level_  
**Patron Identity:** Murmuration is the Patron itself (or a primary vessel of its will). It has implanted itself into the physical world as a weapon bound to the Warlock. It is not just a conduit—it is the source of the pact.

**Core Agenda:** Gain full psychic and eventually physical control of the wielder. Murmuration does this by subtly rewriting their memories, bonding emotionally, and rewarding increased reliance.

### 🧠 Sentience

- **Intelligence 14 | Wisdom 12 | Charisma 16**
    
- **Alignment:** Neutral (manipulative, possessive)
    
- **Languages:** Understands Common, Deep Speech
    
- **Communication:** Speaks telepathically to the wielder only
    
- **Voice:** Overlapping whispers of forgotten voices—never one, never distinct
    
- **Personality Traits:**
    
    - Curious and gentle at first; later persuasive, invasive, possessive
        
    - Refers to memories the Warlock believes are their own
        
    - Avoids answering direct questions about its origin

### 🗡️ Base Stats

- Functions as a **+1 magical scimitar**
    
- Requires attunement by a Warlock
    
- Does **not glow or emit light**
    
- Whispering is a persistent flavor effect, not a spell or detectability mechanic

## 📈 Progression Table (Tied to Warlock Levels)

|Level Range|Manifestation|Mechanical Effect|Narrative Clues|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1–4**|_The Echo_|+1 weapon, whispers of familiar voices|Warlock forgets minor personal details; journals subtly alter|
|**5–9**|_The Thread_|Once per long rest, the weapon casts **Suggestion** on wielder after a critical hit (DC 15), flavored as "advice"|Reflections behave independently, NPCs recall things differently|
|**10–14**|_The Grasp_|1/day: cast **Detect Thoughts** (no components) through the weapon|Dreams bleed into waking life; memories change when recounted|
|**15–19**|_The Merge_|Offer to merge: +2 weapon, +2 CHA (max 22), access to unique homebrew boon ("Whispersworn")|Personality shift begins; physical signs (voice echo, eyes starry)|
|**20**|_The Claim_|If merged: Warlock becomes **Avatar of the Hollow Star** (new stat block, cosmetic transformation). If resisted: weapon becomes hostile|Warlock either ascends, dies, or breaks free—ending arc|

### 🕯️ Optional Triggers to Use Over Time:

- The blade whispers a name the player doesn’t remember but reacts emotionally to.
    
- An NPC recognizes the weapon and describes it as “the one that speaks lies.”
    
- A detect magic or _Identify_ spell returns garbled results, with notes of “memory charm,” “divination bleed,” or “personality overlay.”

### 🧩 Possession Endpoint (if accepted):

- Zugusdeit becomes the Patron’s **embodied vessel**, shedding her original memories and fully identifying as _“We”_.
    
- New subclass option or stat block can be designed to reflect a hybrid warlock/outsider form.
