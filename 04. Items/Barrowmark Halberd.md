## Barrowmark Halberd 
*Melee Weapon (Heavy, Reach, Two-Handed), uncommon (Silvered)*

**Damage**: 1d10 + 1 Slashing
**Mastery**: Cleave
**Weight**: 6 lb.
**Cost**: 120 GP

Traits:
- +1 Bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- **Tactical Drag.** When you hit a creature with an **opportunity attack** using this halberd, that creature’s speed is reduced by **10 feet** until the start of your next turn. 
- **Intimidating Presence.** While visibly carrying this weapon in a populated area, you have **advantage on Charisma (Intimidation)** checks against hostile or aggressive NPCs who recognize it as a weapon of war.

 This hefty polearm is forged of darkened steel with a crescent blade worn from countless clashes. The shaft is bound in oiled hide, and weathered **Uthgardt** barrow runes spiral down its haft — not decorative, but branded deep like a record of the dead. Passed between killers, warriors, and broken men, *this halberd has never been owned — only carried*. It’s a weapon designed to keep foes at a distance, and to punish those who get too close.
