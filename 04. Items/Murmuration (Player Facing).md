This curved, pale-bladed scimitar feels cool to the touch and unnaturally balanced. When you look into the metal, your reflection feels slightly wrong—your face subtly altered, the background stars unfamiliar.  

When you hold the weapon, you hear **soft, overlapping whispers** only you can hear. The voices sound distant and familiar, like people you once knew but no longer remember. They never speak clearly or respond, but they seem to hum along with your heartbeat in battle.
