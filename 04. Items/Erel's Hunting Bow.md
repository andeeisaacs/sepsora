**Erel's Hunting Bow**
_Martial Ranged Weapon (Two-Handed), uncommon (magical, requires attunement)_  
**Damage**: 1d8 + 1 Piercing  
**Mastery**: Slow  
**Weight**: 2 lb.  
**Cost**: 65 GP
**Traits:**
- **Quietstring.** You have **advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks** made to remain hidden **after making an attack** with this bow in woodland or plains environments.
- **Sporewake (Bonus Action, 2 / Long rest).** When you reduce a creature to **0 HP** with this bow, a faint cloud of bio-luminescent spores drifts from the wound, seeking out the nearest creature and seeps into their orifices. Until the end of your next turn, your next ranged attack against any creature closest to the the body **ignores cover** and deals an additional **1d4 psychic damage**. 

The bow's yew has darkened by sweat and weather from many seasons of use. The leather reinforced grip has been worn down with a patina pattern of long and thin fingers. Nestled in a split along the upper limb, a vein of mycelium  — dry and a yellowed pale — still runs beneath the surface like a fossilized scar. When drawn, the wood barely creaks, and sometimes, if held long enough, a spore drifts upward like dust caught in sunbeam.
