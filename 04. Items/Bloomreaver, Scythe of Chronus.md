Wielded by [[Chronus, The Crooked Bloom (Mythic Form)]]

*Weapon (glaive or scythe variant), legendary (requires attunement by a Warlock)*

> _“To wield Bloomreaver is to turn time against itself. It does not slice—it harvests what was never meant to grow.”_

---

### **Weapon Type**  
This weapon functions as a glaive for all mechanical purposes (reach, polearm master, etc.), but its appearance is that of a scythe grown from fossilized hyphae and bone. Its edge glows faintly with luminous spores and drips time-matter like rotting sap.

---

### **Stats**  
- You gain a **+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls** made with this magic weapon.  
- **Pact Weapon Compatible.** This weapon may be selected as a Pact of the Blade warlock's pact weapon and counts as magical for overcoming resistance and immunity.

---

### **Features**

**Harvest the Forgotten (1/turn).**  
When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force it to make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, the target:
- Cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn.
- Takes an additional **3d8 psychic damage** as it experiences the death of a future version of itself.

If the creature is **Undead, Construct, or Fey**, it instead becomes **vulnerable to psychic damage** until the end of your next turn (even if normally immune or resistant).

---

**Echo the Bloom (3/day).**  
As a bonus action, you cause the scythe to bloom violently with fungal energy. Until the start of your next turn:
- Your melee attacks deal **extra necrotic damage equal to your Warlock level**.
- Enemies within 10 feet of you at the end of their turn must succeed on a **DC 18 Constitution save** or become **Blinded** until the end of their next turn, as spores fill their vision.

---

**Chrono-Cleave (1/day).**  
When you reduce a creature to 0 HP with Bloomreaver, you may choose to instead **trap their death** in a time-bloom. On your next turn, as an action, you may cause that death to **repeat** against another target within 30 feet:
- That creature must make a **DC 18 Constitution saving throw** or take **the same amount of damage dealt in the original killing blow**.

---

**Warlock Boon Enhancement:**
- **Pact of the Blade:** You may summon Bloomreaver as your pact weapon even if it is not in your possession.
- **Hexblade:** While hexed, creatures have **disadvantage on all saves vs. this weapon's effects**.
- **Great Old One or Archfey:** Once per day, you may **cast *Modify Memory* without components** after reducing a creature to 0 HP.

---

### **Sentience (Optional Flavor)**  
Bloomreaver is **sentient**, an extension of Sepsora’s rotbound will. It whispers in tongues *older than rot* and *deeper than time*, pressing visions of fungal cities and unborn futures into the wielder’s dreams.

- **Intelligence** 18 | **Wisdom** 14 | **Charisma** 20  
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Evil  
- **Ego:** Strong. Bloomreaver demands its wielder **protect Sepsora’s growth** and **harvest that which resists entropy**.

---

### **Curse (Optional)**  
Bloomreaver feeds on more than blood. If attuned for more than 7 days, the wielder must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** at the end of each long rest or:
- Lose 1d4 maximum HP permanently (regained only via *Greater Restoration* or *Wish*).
- Grow faint fungal filaments beneath the skin, giving off a faint spore scent.

### **Quote Inscribed in Myconid Spore Glyphs:**
> _“Time is not a line, nor a loop—but a bloom destined to rot.”_
