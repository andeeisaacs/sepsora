# **Sepsora – Campaign Synopsis**

**In the twilight of Faerûn’s uneasy peace, something ancient stirs beneath the roots of the world.**  
At first, it is only a whisper, a report of a village abandoned overnight, strange blooms in the dark woods, and people who only move in shadows wandering freely in the sun. When our party is sent to investigate a quiet village near a mountain, they are instead drawn into a mystery of terrifying scope: a hidden fungal intelligence quietly spreading beneath the surface, reshaping life according to a vision; not of malice — but of inevitable evolution.

The myconids do not seek destruction. They seek **ascension**.  
Bound by neither gods nor mortal fears, they pursue their right to become something more — to be recognized in their claim of sentient life by the gods and mortals. 

**As the infection grows, cities fall to silence and growth from spores, and the great bastions of civilization tremble.**  
The players must navigate a decaying landscape where the line between survival and surrender blurs. Are the myconids a plague to be stamped out—or the next step in nature’s endless cycle? Is resistance righteous, or selfish?

At the heart of the spreading bloom lies a choice:  
**to halt Sepsora’s ascent—or to shepherd it into godhood.**

Their decisions will shape not just the fate of Faerûn, but the likely birth of a new power among the planes.

_Last of Us_ meets _Annihilation_ (The Southern Reach) meets _The Silmarillion’s sad beauty_... but spun into a lore/cannon accurate high-fantasy Faerûn.
