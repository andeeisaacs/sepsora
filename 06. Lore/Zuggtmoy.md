## 📖 Lore Summary

Zuggtmoy is an ancient demon lord obsessed with rot, parasitism, and fungal proliferation. She seeks to infect the Material Plane with her spores, slowly converting living things into fungal thralls. Worshippers rarely know her name—many cults revere her unknowingly through mysterious fungal growths or “nature spirits.”

She is deeply patient, allowing infestations to fester in secret until the time is right for mass corruption. Zuggtmoy is not a god in the traditional sense but seeks divinity through parasitic domination and biomass accumulation.
