### Flavor Notes

- **Appearance:** The Shambler’s body is overgrown with strange fungal rot and bulbous growths, its head almost entirely consumed by a cap-like growth. The tree club it carries is fused with biomass and spore sacs that rupture on impact.
- **Sound:** It wheezes wetly with every movement. Combat is punctuated by the faint popping of pustules and squelching of mossy flesh.
- **Smell:** Earth, rot, and a cloying, sweet fungal decay.

### Traits


**Spored aura (Recharge after 3 rounds).**  
As a reaction to taking damage, the Shambler explodes with spores, creating a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on the giant itself. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature's attacks against the giant are made with disadvantage and the creature takes 1d4 infection. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

**Reinforced Frame.**  
The Shambler cannot be knocked Prone or Grappled by Large or smaller creatures.

### Actions

**Multi-attack.** The giant makes two Slam attacks. 

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 19 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be **pushed 10 feet**.

**Hurl Debris.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be **Blinded** until the end of their next turn due to fungal spores.

### Bonus Actions

**Spore Surge (Recharge 6).**  
The giant emits a cloud of spores in a 15-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check and gains 1d4 infection points.

### Weakness: *The Blooming Core* (Secret)

The Hillgiant has multiple growths, surrounding the neck, right calf, left thigh and pecs. Destroying these will land critical hits on the giant and if all are destroyed all it takes is one more successful hit to bring the giant down.


If a player makes a successful DC 15 Nature or Medicine check after a Slam, they discover **swollen, fungal growths along the neck, the right calf, left thigh and across the pecs**

Ankle growths: AC 10
Left Thigh: AC 11
Pectoral: AC 12
Neck: AC 13


 A **called shot** to the growths deals **double damage**. If they destroy all of the growths it kills the Shambler instantly in a gruesome explosion of fungal ooze,
