### **Traits**

**Fungal Hide.**  
When the corrupted cow takes fire, radiant, or lightning damage, it emits a low groan as spores release from ruptured fungal sacs. All creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or become exposed to infectious spores.

> _(Roll a secret 1d4 infection die for each failed save.)_

**Lumbering Bulk.**  
The cow doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving directly toward a creature it can see.

**Spore-Rich Bellow (Recharge 5–6).**  
The corrupted cow lets out a distorted, cavernous moo that vibrates with fungal resonance. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or take **4 (1d8)** poison damage and have **disadvantage on Wisdom checks** until the end of their next turn.

> _(For each creature that fails, roll a secret 1d4 infection die.)_
