## Traits

**Unsettling Appearance:**  
Creatures who see Ham's Flesh-Shed Companion clearly for the first time must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. Hams, his adventuring companions and anyone else who have been granted the gifts of Sepsora are immune to this effect.

**Eye of the Colony:**  
Flesh-Shed Companion communicates telepathically with Ham (up to 120 ft.). Ham can use an action to focus and see through the Flesh-Shed Companions’s sight, becoming blind and deaf to his own surroundings during that time.

**Fungal Camouflage:**  
Flesh-Shed Comnpanion can hide as a bonus action, gaining advantage on stealth checks when near fungal growth or in dim light.

**Keen Sight:**  
Flesh-Shed Companion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Appearance and Personality

Flesh-Shed Companion is a grotesque, fungal aberration born from Ham’s mutation. It is literally Ham's missing eyeball, now self-animated and supported by thin, insectile fungal tendrils fused with what used to be its optic nerves, allowing it to move around on 4 individual, omni-use legs. 
Its pupil is permanently dilated, occasionally splitting into multiple pupils and multi-colored iris' when focusing intently. 

The veins that used to provide the eyeball with red blood and oxygen in the scelra, now have darkened and have a bit of a green hue with blue bruising in areas. 

This Flesh-Shed Companion is loyal only to Ham and follows his commands unquestioningly. It has an eerie curiosity, frequently tilting and rotating itself to better view points of interest. 

If Ham's is knocked unconscious, or dies, the Eyeball may still act independently of Hams.
