Hey everyone, thanks so much for joining me on this campaign!!!

I’m thrilled to have you all here, and I want you to feel totally comfortable asking questions—no such thing as a dumb question, especially at the table.

---

## 1. Mandatory Fun

- **Fun is non-negotiable.** If you’re not having fun, prepare for an endless stream of my worst puns and passive-aggressive prods until your morale improves.
    
- Seriously, we’re here to enjoy ourselves—so let’s do that!

## 2. Rules, Rulings & Rule-Lawyering

- **We’re playing the 2024 5E SRD** (so if you see something unfamiliar, ping me).
    
- **DM = Final Arbiter.** My ruling on any game matter—big or small—is binding at the table.
    
- **Golden Rule: Don’t argue the ruling.**
    
    - If you think I flubbed something, jot it down and we’ll hash it out during a break or at session’s end.
        
    - If you interrupt play to argue after I’ve ruled, I’ve got one “cry-baby point” to give you—and if you try calling my bluff, you risk polite ejection.
        
    - **Exceptions:** Totally cool to say “Hey, I think you missed my bonus on that damage roll” or “Actually, my backstory says…”—that’s not arguing, that’s keeping me honest.

## 3. Respect, Positivity & Safety

- Leave personal drama, grudges, and negativity at the door.
    
- If anything turns toxic, you’ll get one public warning—next time, you’re out.
    
- We’re a team here, collaborating on a story. Let’s keep it friendly and inclusive.

## 4. Prep & Knowledge

- **Before Session 1**, please skim the free 5E SRD2024 Players’ Manual. You don’t need to memorize every spell, but understanding the basics will speed things up.
    
- You should be able to answer:
    
    1. Where do you find your attack bonus?
        
    2. What does AC mean—and what’s yours?
        
    3. What’s a DC? How does a saving throw work?
        
    4. How many actions can you take in a turn?
        
    5. What happens on a natural 20 or a natural 1?
        
- If you can’t answer those, no shame—just ask in session. It’s better to check in than slow everyone down.

---

## 5. Communication & Attendance

- **Discord is our single source of truth.** Check it between sessions and enable notifications for @mentions.
    
- **Can’t make a session?** Please give a 48-hour heads-up in the channel. Emergencies happen—just let us know as soon as you can.
    

---

## 6. Table Etiquette

- **One mic at a time.** Try not to interrupt when someone else (player or DM) is speaking. Unless it par
    
- **In-character banter** (a well-timed “Greedo stabbed first!”) is fine—just don’t derail the story. If you want to remind someone of what their character knows, raise a hand.
    
- **Need a break or to take an urgent text?** Just let us know! Please lets keep phones to an absolute minimum except during breaks, game info lookup or emergencies.
    
- **Distractions = ejection.** We’re here for a few focused hours every other week; let’s give it our full attention and effort!

### TL;DR

1. **Have fun.** Mandatory.
    
2. **DM says so.** Don’t argue rulings now—take notes, we’ll talk later.
    
3. **Be cool.** No toxicity or drama.
    
4. **Prep.** Read the SRD, know the basics.
    
5. **Stay in touch.** Discord, 48-hour notice.
    
6. **Respect the table.** One speaker, hand-raises, breaks ok.
    

That’s it! Any questions before we roll initiative?


# Building your Character!
## Requirements
- Campaign Requirements and restrictions:
	- All characters must be approved by the DM prior to session 1. 
		- All players must have a one 1-on-1 session with the DM regarding the following
			- Race
			- Class
			- Items
			- Background
				- Motives
				- Flaws
				- Goals
				- Relation to other PC's
				- Events in the character's past.
- Tips and Advice

	- Avoid using GPT for anything more than inspiration. It will make up completely false info and stats. 
	- Double, triple check your facts about your character


Baton passing overview:

**Step 1: One-on-One Prompt (Player A)**

- **You:**
    
    > "Tell me about a time _you knew you could trust {next player's} character during an adventure you had together."
    
- **Guide them lightly if needed:**
    - Was it a fight (against someone else, enemy, or with you even)? 
    - A sacrifice? 
    - A clever idea they had that saved you?
    -  A moment of shared laughter during danger?
    - Silly moment perhaps drinking in the tavern or situation where they got you out of a social mess (thats a dude, dude...oh god he doesnt know he's about to be pegged, oh shit i need to go over there and get him out that)

**Step 2: Write Down a Quick Anchor**

- 1-2 bullet points about the memory.
    
- Then _use that as your opening prompt_ for Player B’s flashback!
    

**Step 3: Continue Down the Line**

- Each new player’s intro builds off the previous player’s memory.
    

**Final Step: Close the Loop**

Last player recalls the moment they realized they were actually a solid adventuring party.
