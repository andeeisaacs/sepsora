## Under Pressure

Full recap of sessions 5 act 2 and full outline of Session 6 act 2:
Our heroes, awaken from their long rest after a long arduous previous day. When they awaken, they find Arcturus, somehow awakening with them as if having been there the whole time but Johann still missing from the party. The cart now stopped, they could hear the sound of Holt chatting with guards. Some eaves dropping reveals that Holt is chummy with the guards, on first name basis and that they are at the eastern gate of Secomber. 

The party overhears that Secomber is dealing with a strange docile 'Drow' invasion and Druids kidnapping people in the night, along with worries about the burning fires of towns in the distance. Secomber is on high alert and normally an open trade market, now is locked down and suspicious of outsiders. 

The guards, tired and smooth talked by Holt allowed her and her cart passage only to become suspicious of what she was hauling due to being strange she only has one cart and is driving it herself. 

Some quick thinking by the party allowed Arcturus to cast a spell causing fire to erupt on a nearby weapons rack and barrel of oil- lighting a small portion of the wall they were passing through on fire. This proved excellent distraction and opportunity for Holt whip the horses and gallop the cart away rapidly before they could inspect Holt's 'goods' she was hauling in the back, which would have landed them either in jail or worse for smuggling people. 

Once firmly within the city center's urban areas, Holt advised the party that they ditch the cart, and split off, coming back together at a later time after they figure out a way through Secomber now knowing they are likely fully locked down after the apparent 'attack at the gates'. Holt and the last living member of the Greyhall family, Nola departed from the party. 

Our heroes found a nearby inn/tavern and decided to inquire the locals for the best place to restock on goods and a meal. They order food and talk while two guards enter the establishment, coming off duty and talking about how odd it was that one of the Druids showed up soaking wet and unconscious in the morning just inside town. The guards think its part of the odd druids who are kidnapping people, especially considering the druid had drow ears, but the tricorn really sent them for a loop. 

The party immediately recognizes that description of of the druid as Johann, taking note. They also speak with a cloaked figure in the cornr, trying to mind their own business, who when they get a good look at realize she is a Drow, has bruises on her face and is hesitant to talk to them. She corroborates the gate guards conversation with Holt from earlier, and explains how they are locking anyone and everyone up that looks like a Drow or has druidic abilities. The whole town is suspicious as folk are being taken every day and a strange group of Druids have been seen stalking and watching the city near-by. Additionally, they captured Lolth Drows who were in town, oddly standing right in the town square, along with some just walking towards the town on foot, but either unarmed, or if they did have weapons, acted docile. She mentioned something about their pupils always dilating and contracting. 

Arcturus uses mask of many faces and disguises herself as a guard, then gets more information from the other guards off duty. they reveal that Johann is in the city prison under special watch due to the odd nature of him appearing in town. Arcturus, takes the party to the city guard headquarters and gains access under pretense of bringing in 3 new prisoners. 

Once the party is in the basement prison hall, they see the Lolth-Garb Drows acting unresponsive in their cells, multitudes of various druids, some wearing a red arm band with a symbol on it, others keeping their distance, all locked up. Its obvious many people who are imprisoned are there under false reasonings and most of the Drow are simply in jail due to fearful prejudice and the unfortunate history of Drow people. 

The party ends up talking with a group of Druids who approach their cell bars and recognize the party has being 'Sepsora's Sovereign', welcoming them but confused as to why they are there and unaware of happenings are going on around them. They invite the players to their circle, and finally inform the players that the growth spreading across the land is just the next step of nature, inevitable and right. Its name is 'Sepsora' and its about to happen now. At that moment the Lolth-Garb Drows in the distant cells explode into spores, creating a new ground-zero in Secomber. Within seconds spores choke and kill inmates and guards alike, some immediately being mutated with others turned into 'infrastructure'. 

A long fight ensues, as the players defend themselves from all directions against Druids who are seemingly unharmed by the spores, additional explosions in the cells and mutated secomber guards break free and attack the nearest living creatures. 

The party manages to get Johann free, and find various guards having stole his items, recover his scimitar, shield and Tricorn hat. He and the rest of the party retreat into a room with a set of stairs leading down, and barricade the metal door from the inside from an onslaught of countless mutated beings rushing into the prison. 

End session.

---

## Battlefield Features

- **Narrow Corridors:** Movement slowed if more than 2 characters wide.
    
- **Iron Cells:** Guards attempt to grapple/shove PCs into open cells and slam doors (DC 15 Str to break out).
    
- **Spore Hazards:** At initiative count 20 each round, spores rain from the ceiling: Con save DC 13 or 1d4 poison damage + cough (disadvantage on next attack).
    

---

## Tactics

- Druids open with _Entangle_ to pin PCs, then move to area denial (_Flaming Sphere_).
    
- Guards form shield wall, forcing PCs into choke points.
    
- Jailor focuses on one PC, trying to drop them fast.
    
- Mid-fight escalation: when first druid dies, another casts _Conjure Animals_ (2 giant spiders reflavored as fungal horrors).
    

---

## XP Budget

- Druids (3 × 450 = 1,350 XP)
    
- Guards (4 × 100 = 400 XP)
    
- Veteran (700 XP)
    
- Fungal Horrors (2 × 200 = 400 XP, mid-fight)  
    **Total = 2,850 XP → Deadly+ for APL ~3.6.**
    

---

## Escape Trigger

At about round 3–4:

- More fungal roots break through the walls, and the druids go silent, happy to be consumed by Sepsora.
    
- Party realizes the reinforcements will overwhelm them.
    
- Jailor shouts: _“Seal the exits! Don’t let them leave alive!”_  
    This should strongly signal that survival = retreat.
    

---

## Rewards

- If they grab loot while fleeing:
    
    - **Guard’s Ring of Keys** (useful for future prison infiltration).
        
    - **Druidic Fungus Pouch**: acts as 3× _goodberry_ uses per day, but berries look like moldy growths.
        
    - Whisper of Sepsora’s corruption—seeds further paranoia.
        

---

### Optional Alternatives

1. **Harder (if party too strong):** Add animated armor infused with fungus (CR 1). Pros: raises tension; Cons: may risk TPK if not careful.
    
2. **Easier (if they’re new players):** Reduce to 2 druids and 3 guards. Pros: more manageable; Cons: less apocalyptic vibe.
    
3. **Cinematic Twist:** The druids never intended to kill the party—only to “infect” them. On retreat, each PC must roll a Con save DC 13 or take on a minor corruption mutation. Pros: story hook; Cons: players may resist forced changes.
