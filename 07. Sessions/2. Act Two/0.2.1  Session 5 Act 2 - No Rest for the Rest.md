### Notable events recap of session 4: 

Hams underwent a transformation, losing his Eyeball to Flesh Shed Companion mutation, however quickly befriending it and now gaining a companion friend. 
Zugusdeit was able to claim Harlan's wedding band, and after securing it in her pocket, after a bit felt it warming up (secretly due to Mira being in danger)

The heroes realized that Moss and Hide was ground zero for the infection spread in Zellbross after being found by Holt, were able to make all of the right decisions and avoid confrontation/Encounters at both the **Scene 1: The Stone Cradle ( Infront of Moss and Hide)**, and **Scene 2: Merchant's Market (Town Square)** (Scene 2 was modified to be actually one of two of Holt's drivers and carts, giving the urgency to the players to arrive at the last remaining cart where the last surviving driver, Mira and Nola remained. )

They were able to be guided by Holt and with quick thinking by the party with their abilities to have relatively safe passage, they turned the last corner to find Nola, Mira and the Driver under siege by 3 corrupt peasants. Driver was brutally killed by his enemy as well. While running to the cart. Mira was mortally wounded and Nola hoisted Mira up onto the cart. The heroes and Holt dashed to the cart, Holt taking the driving reigns and the heroes escaped Zelbross narrowly, with Jinn performing a javilin throw that would cause the already partially crumbling "Welcome to Zelbross" sign to fall down on the flood of corrupt townsfolk that started chasing after them, affording the cart and its occupants enough time and put distance between the fallen Zelbross and them. 

While on the cart, Mira would succumb to her wounds, but not before Zugusdeit attempted to heal her, which caused no change in her mortal status, but did ease the pain. Mira's final words to her daughter before dying were "its okay baby.. its okay.. I want to be with Harlan.. its ok.." while placing in Nola's hand her wedding ring.

Nola now realizing she was the last of her family, clutched the ring, along with Zugusdeit providing her her fathers ring, and screamed. Within mere moments, Mira's body stood straight up on the moving cart, looked at the party, looked at Nola, back at the party and then dove straight out of the cart's tarped side with surprising vitility and strength. The session ended with the party gaining level 4 and mechanically provided a long rest, with many questions left unanswered, except for the fact they have escaped Zelbross, and that there is a hint of information that this (as the players call it) infection/corruption, may not be acting on the will of some evil deity, but rather just nature finding its next evolution.

Session 1, Act 2:  No Rest For the Rest

extended Recap of session 4 act 1:
- After the battle with the grotesquely mutated Harlan Grayhall- Hams, Zugusdeit and Jinn found they were alone, missing two people from their party: Arcturus and Johann, both of which had mysteriously disappeared without much trace. 
- Ham's underwent a transformation, Fled-Shed Companion, where his left eyeball removed itself from his skull and became animated. All three companions now suffering from some type of physical change. 
- After a brief breather, the three companions were found by a slightly wartorn Tressa Holt who arrived at the Moss and Hide in hopes of finding and possibly saving Harlan. 
- Tressa Holt was accosted earlier by Nola and Mira Grayhall, who were fleeing from Moss and Hide. They told her the story of how Calen had arrived at Moss and Hide
	- He arrived in a daze, from the High Forest, shortly after the heroes had left to find him and Erel, and upon being brought into the shop, promptly exploded into gore and spores.
	- Harlan had been closest to Calen at the time, and died due to asphyxiation from the gas cloud of spores that Calen's body released upon explosion. 
	- Harlan became the catalyst, and resource for the growth, essentially patient zero and ground zero for the spread throughout Zelbross.
- Tressa noticed the mutations on the heroes and became a bit suspicious, as she had to battle her way to here, watching in real time the spread of this fungal towards the edges of the town.
- Tressa Holt, always one to keep her word, having heard of the demise of Erel and seeing first hand the effects it has not only on Harlan, but on the heroes as well, guides them back to her promised carts that arrived earlier.
- The heroes, led by Tressa, through the middle and western part of the settlement- discovering one of her two trade carts had been overrun.
- Once the heroes arrived to the west entrance of the settlement, they were met with the driver, Nola and Mira defending the cart from taken towns people.
- The driver is slain, Mira is mortally wounded and Nola rises to defeat multiple of the towns people before the heroes are even able to get close enough. 
- Once on the cart, Tressa Holt helms the two horse drawn cart and flees the town with Nola, Mira and the heroes in the back.
- Jinn, thinking fast, throws her spear and manages to down the Welcome to Zellbross sign upon an encroaching horde of taken townspeople giving chase. This stopped them momentarily, but enough to allow the cart to gain distance and flee safely.
- Mira, being mortally wounded, was comforted by Nola as she would succumb to her wounds. Zugusdeit, wanting to atleast ease the pain, attempted to heal her. This gave Mira enough life before perishing- her final words "Its okay, I want to be with Harlan.".
- Nola, filled with grief at the realization that she is the last of her family, screamed in agony clutching both her father and her mother's wedding bands in each hand.
- Within seconds, Mira's corpse stood up, her wounds covered by a fungal membrane and her eyes white, she then considered her chances against the cart of heroes and Nola, and chose to dive off the cart in the middle of the night, disappearing into the forest.

### Opening Scene:

Build out:
- Heroes awaken to Tressa Holt being hassled by Secomber guards. 
	- Guards weary due to possible Drows, also Tress normally has a cart of goods, right now she has a cart of refugees.  Guards are feeling suspicious of her despite her reputation. 
	- Arcturus placed back into the cart: [[Kronos, The Crooked One]] provides information, needed to displace Arcturus and show him the future.  (Corrupt Druid's Circle outside of town, Emmisary meeting, Waterdeep- then, whats perturbing to Kronos, is once they arrive at Waterdeep, Kronos cannot see past that point.)
- Johann is imprisoned in the town's jail, due to being a druid and having a mutation- also there have been druids coming and going, talking of 'Natures Right' (The druids think the Myconids infection is natures right in the world, its just nature doing nature. But in a much more perverse logical fallacy they are under), people going missing.  Druids left town. 
- Zugusdeit's Murmuration Dream: Reveal how Murmuration was provided- Murmuration is annoyed by the mutation, gaslighting, providing more power through a memory of their mentor, always a bit of a blurry face, do wisdom rolls to discover more information. 
	- Make list of possible NPCs Murmuration has taken the form of in Zugusdeit's past. 
	- Nat 20 reveals Murmuration is a god within the weapon itself, trapped there.
- Hams morning feeling is that this feels right- they are on the road, trying to protect. Trying to get people safe and to their place. Thinking of family- sudden dread, realizing this shit is spreading everywhere which means their family may not be safe- starts thinking about wanting to check on their family. Need to get to Waterdeep.

# Wake up...

Roll for who gets their dream first (Jinn, Hams, Zugusdeit)

### Zugusdeit: 2
Orphanage, never knew family, picked on, forced to become stronger. One day kids say "Want to see something?" and lead her to a corpse in a back alley, withered and wielding Murmuration. Picked up Murmuration and moments later a cloaked figure, backlit, walks up and starts talking to Zugusdeit, mentioning how its unsafe to be in alleys alone and that she is lucky they came along. Fast forward to years later, being trained in an abandoned warehouse, mentor always staying in the shadows a bit, same voice but different.. feel. Teaching how to wield the blade and use Warlock powers with it. Last memory of hearing mentors voice in last battles, almost as though they were standing near by telling Zugusdeit when and how to move. Recollecting that when using the 'exploding die' the mentor is giving grief, the feeling of letting her mentor down as Zugusdeit mutates.  (Ask for a [[🦠 Infection Tracker – Sepsora Campaign (DM-Only)]] roll)
### ZUGUSDEIT 🎲 Mutation 11 — "Spore Cone" 

**Mutation:** When exposed to focused light or magical illumination, spores clinging to your skin shimmer faintly — and shift. Wherever you are, your presence emits something unseen but _felt_. People nearby tend to complain about being short of breath as if reacting to a sickness in the air. 

**Penalty:** –1 to Constitution saves 

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, exhale a 10 ft. cone of spore-heavy breath. All living creatures within the cone have Disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.  

**DM Note:** Begin with animals backing away, or NPCs coughing when nearby. Let the players notice their posture always reorients toward heat or heartbeats. Rename: **Lure Bloom**


### Hams:3
Restful sleep, dreams of jumping out from a bush or noticing someone a bit too drunk getting taken advantage of and mugged outside of a tavern. Hams acting on those moments and discovering his true calling of being a ranger of the roads, helping those. Dreamstate shifts to his adventuring companions, feeling right at home with them as they all loved adventure and his cooking, glad to have met them. Dreamstate shifts to being back inside Calen's house, looking up at Erel's torn and twisted body on the ceiling, pulled apart in multiple ways. THe face shifts to the face of his older sister who was killed. Dreamshifts to the woman's face he investigated in Brindlewild, the woman merging with the door, but her face is that of his mothers. Wake up, feeling the sudden need to check on his family.  (Ask for a [[🦠 Infection Tracker – Sepsora Campaign (DM-Only)]] roll)

### Jinn:1
Enjoying Grandma's stew, a memory- asking Jinn why they were dishonorably discharged from the militia. Asking about how Jinn came into owning the Halberd. Asking why Jinn is fused to the chair, and only half of her body exists anymore, with the stew falling out of her ribcage with each bite. Grandma gives Banshee wail, eyes membraning over. Wake up.  (Ask for a [[🦠 Infection Tracker – Sepsora Campaign (DM-Only)]] roll)

----
### Arcturus: 
Flashback to the fight, something catches his eye (Perception roll to notice its The Crooked One), the smell of burning wet flesh as the sight of Zellbross on fire infront of them becomes blinding. 
Arcturus finds themselves standing in a grove, a druid's grove with tall pillars that are overgrown with moss and mushrooms, membrane creeps across with a liquid motion as it grows over and into the runes carved on the collumn. Arcturus can hear the crooked one telling them "Do you want to see your kingdom come? To rule it once more, with the faces of the schemers and liars and traitors cast in metal and stone as they watch you take your seat? Then you must bare witness to what must come to pass."
Around Arcturus is many druids, seemingly stopped in time, circling around what looks like a person, a dryad? No, an elf.. ? Grotesquely disfigured but from the hands of the being, are vine like growths branching out and slithering into the orphices of each of the many druids, through eyes, through nose, through mouth, as they seem to be praying to it. The figure clicks its head in a sudden turn and looks right at Arcturus.
Arcturus finds themselves standing at distance from the entire party, unable to move, the background and surroundings is far too dark to be able to tell the location, but infront of the party, with Arcturus themselves standing among their companions- is something hard to visualize other than.. what could be described as a masses of hands veined, growth pocked, forming an single eye'd head, reaching up. 
Time is stopped yet again, "**There is another version of this moment, in which.. your companions ability to be diplomatic is found... wanting."** a flash to the same scene, but Hams head is being crushed with a sickly crack while trapped in one of the hands. Zugusdeit's body looks withered and with membrane creeping over her chest with a massive hole in it. Johann's body is being reconfigured and reconstructed into something different completely while Jinn is balled up into a fetal position while her ribs crack and implode into her body. 
"**Do not allow the acts of one to dictate the fate of many."**.
Suddenly Arcturus stands atop the city walls of Waterdeep, looking over the lands to the east, the trees shake and fall, as spores rise to the air, creating a sickly green and brown hue as the sun shines through it- the world is overcome and below them, at the city wall, is a frozen scene of what seems to be legions upon legions of mutated species attempting to claw and break the wall, a truely massive onslaught of apparent enemies attempting to break into the city. The sound of glass breaking, wailing of many mouths screaming at once, and then Arcturus finds themselves sitting in the back of Holt's Cart, looking at their sleeping companions.  Whispering in Arcturus' ear "That is the moment in which I, the one who can see in omni-perspective, can no longer see past. If you wish for your contract to be honored, and your soul to remain yours and your royal seat regained, you *will* be certain to find yourself at that last moment and bring me answers."


### Johann
Johann awakens in a damp, dark cell, his only light from a brazier outside the cell between two robed guards. You head aches, your feet feel the cold stone below, your pack, weapons and shield have been llibrated from you. As you realize this, glimpses of the past night come to you. Harlan falling infront of your companions as you slowly descend back down. Suddenly hands grasping at your face, your wrists, your throat, you legs, hands covering your mouth and eyes. The feeling of being pulled downwards, the rush of temperature change on your skin from the warm summer night air into a damp cramped space.  You feel your body plunge into water, the feeling of panic setting in as you believe you are about to drown, and then the feeling of your familiar dismissing from being out of range, giving you your only clue to how fast and far you are being taken, but then you feel the flaps below your jawline open, pulling the water in and releasing air into your lungs. Then you are caught by something, like being stuck to something adjacent to a spider web.. but its not. 

The next thing you know is you can hear something in your mind, music? A chorus of different sounds, its beautiful and yet its nothing like you've ever heard before, like a whole city of languages all somehow meshing together to form something new, something you start to understand. words. All within your mind feelings take shape of words. 
"Reallocate resource?",  the feeling of disagreement, "Sovereign drone", feeling of realization, "gifts provided prior", expression of understanding as you feel something crawling through your jawline, rearranging it some more, "relocate to front", a feeling of agreement ,"optimal positioning for other sovereigns" and your body being pulled and moved through the 'webbing', speedily and suddenly pulled upwards out of water. 


The next moment you can remember is looking up at the sky as clouds move overhead, day just starting to break, a guard comes into view, a whistle, prodding with sharp tips on various parts of your body, 
"its one of those fuckin druids",
"No shit?  You mean the rooks were right?? they werent just seein' shit???
"Oh what the fuck is that under his chin?" the feeling of something prodding at your jawline
"Oh fuck no get 'im in the fuckin cells with the others, first the drows now this shit fuck",
"What the fuck is goin' on with the world, cant even trust them now neither", "bet 'es a spy for em." 
"yea prolly"
Everything else is a blur leading up to your awakening in this cell.

### Part 1: Arrival & Rumors in Town (Secomber or Uluvin)

"Look Holt, we like ya in all but hell is breaking loose. Thems keeping us on full duty watch ever since the drows decided they wanted up an them druids pullin' peoples and shit we think zellbross even burnd down last night"

Holt: "Oh damn, thats wild. Look, I get it, but if I dont give the horses a break they're likely to pass out"

Guard: "I dont knows what to tell yas Holt, govners orders"

Holt: "Listen, let me through, i'll get these horses some rest for a few hours and then i'll be on my way, i'm just passin' through anyhow before we get to 'deep, okay? Look, i'll even knock a few of the tavern tab"

Guard: "Well shit Holt, why didin't you just open with that instead..."

the sound of wooden gates creaking and opening, horses hooves clack as they start walking forward, the cart jolts forward as it starts to move. 

You're all awake.

"Holt, wait up a moment, quick question-"
"Yeah Jeremy?"
"Aint you normally got two carts? I dont think I ever recall you ever coming through seated up there, let alone.. wait hold on, what you hauling anyhow?"
"Jeremy..."
Footsteps coming around the cart. What do you do?

-----



- **Narration:**
	- The town is girding itself for the unknown: shuttered windows, nervous militia pacing and preparing for war, and wary and discriminating glances at the darker-skinned Drow locals.
		City gates are littered with "MISSING" and "HAVE YOU SEEN?" posters of the towns locals family and friends who have gone missing in the last week.  "Wanted" posters of  non-descript Drows and Druids, "see something say something, its your duty"

- **Social Roleplay & Investigation:**
	- **Guards** and townspeople saw the fires of Zelbross at night.
		- Tower guards mentioned seeing strange low hanging colored clouds, smoke and odd shimmering clouds (Indicating Sepsora's spores being spread into the air)
    - The party is questioned—guards are suspicious, locals desperate for answers.
	    - If players reveal they came from Zelbross, the guards or loyal town sperson brings them or reports them to the town leader.
		 - If players conceal their involvement with Zellbross
			 - If disguised well: Freely move through town.
				 - Local inquiries reveal rising racism and hatred aimed at the Drow amid whispered rumors they started the fungal infection as a biological weapon (These rumors started due to Drows showing up in town, Lolth garbed. Reports from surrounding settlements of that being the start before somekind of overgrowth happens to the town. )
				 - Local rumors: Druids left town a week ago, and since then sightings of them coming at night- people going missing. People are scared to be out at night. Local tavern and inn is basically empty.
				 - Local rumors:
		
    - Town leader is puzzled, and on high alert, perpetuating the misinformation and panic
	    - Learns of Tressa Holt and the goods she has, wants to keep the cart and goods.
    - Tressa tries to keep trade connections; players can visit the local market for supplies but note the shortage and pricey goods.
- **Encounters:**
    - NPC townsfolk range from fearful to hostile about Drow.
    - Maybe a minor scuffle or protest breaks out, offering roleplay and tension.
    - Optional: A cautious Drow NPC appeals to the players privately to defend their kind’s innocence.

### Part 2: The Prison Investigation

- **Accessing the Prison:** (possibly underground? Could become a short 'dungeon crawl' out for the players)
    - The party is led by tense guards to the holding cells where several Drow are imprisoned
	    - All but two are obviously innocent and jailed without true cause.
    - A Lolth soldier garbed Drow sits inside of a barred cell, unresponsive, sitting with his back to the wall, and staring into nothingness. 
	    - Shallow breaths. 
	    - Not really strange because Elves don't' sleep and meditate. 
	    - Only received him a day ago. 
	    - Arrived in the town overnight, standing in town square. 
		    - Acted docile.
		    - Dried blood on him.
		    - Had a weapon, a Lolth Glaive, but did not brandish it. 
	    
- **Suspense & Horror:**
    - Investigating: 
	    - Signs of fungal infection creeping along the prison walls, black mold spreading like small nanotube like veins from the one of the Drow who is sitting.
	    - Reportedly hasn't moved away from the wall all day. 
	    - Hasn't spoken a word. 
    - Strange noises, a putrid damp smell.
    - Guards grow uneasy, some refuse to enter certain sections.
- **Key Event — The Exploding Prisoner:**
    - Suddenly, the Drow prisoner convulses and bursts in a violent, spore cloud, but not before the mold veins fatten and engorge to puff out spores. 
    - Infected guards and prisoners mutate rapidly into fungal horrors.
    - Combat and chaotic evacuation follow, forcing the party to contain or escape the spreading corruption.
- **Aftermath:**
    - Town panic rises, and Drow scapegoating intensifies.
    - The party gathers grim evidence the fungal infection uses the Drow as unwilling vectors, complicating prejudices.
- **Moral Weight:**
    - Players face the dilemma of how much to disclose or suppress.
    - Opportunities to protect or clear the accused Drow’s names.

---

### Clues & Foreshadowing

- NPC whispers about a strange druidic circle embracing the infection.
- Sightings of fungal growth spreading beyond control along roadways.
- Hints the infection is not “just nature” but something evolving.

---

### Session Conclusion

- The party is tasked or decides to track down the druid circle deep in the corrupted woods.
- Emphasize the feeling that they are racing a spreading, unstoppable blight—no one is safe, and the infection is already ahead of them.

Would you like me to prepare expanded NPC stats and motives for key figures in this combined session? Or perhaps detailed descriptions and combat tactics for the exploding fungal prisoner and resulting fungal mutations?
