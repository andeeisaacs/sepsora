## **OPTION B: Ingress Through Zelbross**

### 🎤 **Introductory Narrative (read verbatim):**

> You step into Zelbross beneath the oppressive midnight sky. The familiar streets are now twisted nightmares—walls ripple with gelatinous moulde, glistening like wet muscle. Buildings lean at unnatural angles, as though breathing deeply in slow, rhythmic pulses. A sickening scent of rot and mold fills your senses, and faint movement flickers at the edge of your vision. Ahead, the quickest route to Holt’s cart leads straight through this corrupted heart.

_(Pause here briefly to let players declare marching order or immediate caution.)_

## 🕳️ **Scene 1: The Stone Cradle (Town Crossroads)**

### 🎤 **Narrative Reveal (read verbatim):**

> At the village crossroads, you spot the old stone well. A single figure crouches oddly beside it, motionless and bent forward at an impossible angle. His arms and legs are grotesquely elongated, slick tendrils spreading from his open back, meticulously embedding themselves into the stone. He shudders softly, and something thick and viscous drips slowly from his slack jaw.

### 🔍 **Scene Details & Checks:**

- **Passive Insight (no roll required):** The figure is alive, actively being converted into fungal infrastructure. His twitching eyes silently beg for release.
    

|Action|Check (DC)|Consequence on Fail|
|---|---|---|
|Quietly move past|Group Stealth (DC 14)|Alerts the figure, triggering Spore Burst attack|
|Examine growth closely|Nature (DC 14)|Trigger fungal retaliation (Spore Burst)|
|Mercy kill or disturb|No check, auto-triggers Spore Burst||

**Reactive Threat:**

- Use **"Harlan Grayhall" stat block** (renamed as "Crossroads Host").

## 🛒 **Scene 2: Merchant's Market (Town Square)**

### 🎤 **Narrative Reveal (read verbatim):**

> The town square has become a nightmarish spectacle. A merchant’s overturned cart sits partially sunken into slimy cobblestones. At its base, a man writhes weakly, his body dissolving through the stone into an unseen mass below. The street ripples subtly, something massive lurking just beneath the surface, reshaping human limbs and animal bones into new, unsettling configurations.

### 🔍 **Scene Details & Checks:**

- **Environmental storytelling:** Players clearly see fungal efficiency repurposing the merchant into organic material for a hidden construct beneath the stones.
    

|Action|Check (DC)|Consequence on Fail|
|---|---|---|
|Carefully bypass cart area|Group Acrobatics (DC 13)|Alert hidden threat beneath|
|Rescue merchant (futile)|Investigation (DC 14)|Disturb slime lurker (combat starts immediately)|
|Discern fungal purpose|Medicine/Nature (DC 15)|Misinformation causes hesitation or panic|

**Reactive Threat:**

- **"Slime Lurker"**
    
    - Use **Membrane Node stats**
        
    - Attacks from beneath cobblestones, visibly forming new limbs mid-combat.

## 🛡️ **Scene 3: The Welcome Arch (West Gate)**

### 🎤 **Narrative Reveal (read verbatim):**

> At the edge of Zelbross, under the broken "Welcome" arch, stands a town guard. Even from a distance, you see something wrong: his body is rigid yet subtly shifting, slick membranes reconstructing muscles visibly beneath his skin. His armor bulges grotesquely, filled with pulsating fungal threads, his eyes replaced by gelatinous cysts tracking your every step.

### 🔍 **Scene Details & Checks:**

|Action|Check (DC)|Consequence on Fail|
|---|---|---|
|Move quietly around arch|Stealth (DC 14)|Disturb guard (immediate attack)|
|Observe from distance|Perception (DC 13)|Misinterpret its movement; disadvantage next check|
|Disable threat quickly|Ranged Attack or spell|Missed attack triggers violent retaliation|

**Reactive Threat:**

- **"Moulde Marionette"** (Town Guard)
    
    - Use modified "Harlan Grayhall" stats
        
    - Special Reaction: On taking fire/radiant damage, violently bursts open spores (15-ft radius, DC 14 CON save or +1d4 Infection Die).
