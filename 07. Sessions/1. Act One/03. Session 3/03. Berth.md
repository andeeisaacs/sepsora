## **OPTION A: Wide Berth (Sneaking)**

> (Narrative framing for players if chosen):  
> You drop low into the long grass, feeling the damp chill of midnight dew. Ahead, the distant forms of buildings loom like shadows, illuminated faintly by occasional flickers of ghostly blue-green phosphorescence. From within Zelbross drifts the unsettling sound of wet movement, slow and deliberate.

**Risks (Moulde Awareness Clock):**

- Every failed group check ticks up the clock. At **3 ticks**, they are noticed by something alien and hostile.
    

|Action|Check|Consequence on Fail|
|---|---|---|
|Cross unseen into tall grass|Stealth (DC 15)|1 tick (alert something nearby)|
|Peer through a fence gap|Perception (DC 14)|Fail: Gain misinformation (hallucination spores)|
|Traverse a slimy trench|Survival (DC 13)|Disturb moulde: 1 tick|

**Potential Encounter:**  
**Slime-cart** (Blind sensory-hunting slime-moulde beast pulling merchant fusion)—

- **Avoidable**: DC 13 Insight reveals its blindness and reliance on sound. Remain quiet to bypass.
    
- If disturbed, it erupts into defensive flailing.
