# Session 3 - Return

## Recap
----

> Just after sunset, the party learned what the 'wrong sounds' belonged to they heard when they arrived to the small forest village of Brindlewild. 
> 
> Time slowed to a crawl and afforded Arcturus a rare meeting before the fight that would ensue, a chance to speak with The Crooked One who showed great interest in what was happening there. They left Arcturus with a scolding for allowing themselves to be harmed by Johann's actions, a warning to not break their contract by dying, granting of promised power and a singular piece of advice: Survive or be consumed as per pact agreement. 
> 
> After surviving a deadly encounter with a malformed hill giant, various gruesome visages of what something thinks a wolf should be and a space-invading cow, the creatures were seemingly called by an unseen or perhaps unheard command, causing them to lose interest in the fight and head north down the main road inside the High Forest, leading them away from the ruined and overgrown village.
> 
>  **This wasn't an act of mercy It’s not mercy on their behalf—it’s an act of prioritization.** 
>  
> Not wanting to stick around any longer than needed, you left the settlement via the way you arrived to return to Zelbross with urgency to inform the family of Erel's demise and the corruption that took over, claim your reward and get on Holt's promised merchant cart ride that would significantly cut down your travel time back home. 
> 
> On the return path the ***tall-for-a-halfling ranger*** in the party noticed that there was a distinct set of tracks leading off path, and a satchel caught on a low hanging branch- not left there by choice, but seemingly caught by someone rushing off path and into the forest.
> 
> On first gleaning inside the satchel, it revealed various survival goods one might find for a hunter, but most intriguingly was a field journal, belonging to Calen, that recorded the mundane previous months of hunting followed by a discovered passage to the Underdark, strange occurrences in the forest and a mysterious appearance of a Drow clad with Lolth warrior garb in broad daylight acting unusually calm and unresponsive in Brindlewild. The journal's dated logs ended just short of when Calen would be arriving with the delivery for Moss & Hide. 
> 
 Now you've broken the treeline and are now witnessing the scene of Zelbross mid emergency. A in-recent-years bustling trade hub settlement now being brought to ruin once again with the sounds of death and fighting, smoke surrounding the settlement due to buildings and person building, the sickly sweet smell you've encountered before and the sinking feeling in your gut that this is somehow related.
 
 ***what do you do?***
 



#  **CURRENT SITUATION (read verbatim):**  
> You stagger from the forest under the shroud of midnight. The stars overhead are blurred by drifting smoke, and Zelbross lies ahead, bathed in patches of pale moonlight and deep shadow. Even from here, you can see movement—slow and wrong—amongst the buildings, and the scent of damp, moldy decay hangs thickly in the still, cool air. Somewhere inside waits Holt, your promised reward, and your escape.

---

### ⚖️ **PLAYER DECISION POINT (read verbatim):**

> **You face a choice:**
> 
> - You can **try to give Zelbross a wide berth**, creeping carefully along the darkened outskirts, hoping to avoid notice and reach Holt unnoticed—but moving slowly and risking detection at every step.
>     
> - Or you can **move swiftly through Zelbross**, directly facing whatever horrors now inhabit the town’s corrupted heart, potentially cutting precious time off your escape—but inviting greater danger.
>     

**(Pause here for player choice.)**


~~Take the Wide [[03. Berth]]~~

Take the ingress: [[03. Ingress]]

> **SITUATION:** Zelbross is visibly in crisis. Smoke rises, fungal blooms scatter on the wind, and strange lights flicker inside the ruined quarter. Something is wrong—_very wrong_—but Tressa Holt and their only way out may still be inside.

---

### ✅ PHASE ONE: PLAYER CHOICE

After cresting out of the forest path, the party must choose:

- **A) Wide Berth Sneak**: Circle the outer edges to avoid danger.
    
- **B) Push Through Zelbross**: Move directly through the ruined heart.
    

---

# 🅰️ WIDE BERTH: Sneaking Around Zelbross

**Goal:** Reach Holt’s cart (still hitched and waiting) _without being noticed_ by whatever is inside the town.

### ❗Tension Framing (Callout for Verbatim Use)

> The wind shifts, and with it comes the unmistakable scent of rot and damp mushrooms. Zelbross’s edge lies ahead, but something is wrong. The path in winds straight into the village… but the tall grass and fence rows along the edge might offer cover. Not safety—never that. Just... cover.

---

### 💀 RISK CLOCK: The Town Is _Awake_

Each failed group check ticks up a "fungal awareness clock." At 3 ticks, they’re spotted by an infected villager or beast.

|Action|Check|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Crawl low through the fence line|Stealth DC 15|Fail = 1 tick|
|Peer into a window|Perception DC 14|Success = Gain insight on one horror inside|
|Move past the barn|Survival DC 13|Fail = Disturb ground fungus (1 tick)|
|Pass the open well|Con Save DC 14|Fail = Light coughing, 1d4 Infection Die|

---

### 🎭 Optional Encounter: _The Spore Mule_

> **Trigger:** On final stealth check or at 3 ticks.

- An infected horse-drawn cart lurches into view, the _horse_ a fungal-fused monstrosity dragging a half-melded merchant fused into the cart’s bench. It does not attack unless disturbed.
    
- **Insight check (DC 13)** reveals: the horse is **blind** but **hearing-based**—it might ignore them if they remain silent.
    

---

### 🎯 Outcome

- **Success:** Reach Holt and her cart unnoticed. Holt reveals Mira & Nola are hidden in the cart, and they must move _now._
    
- **Partial Failure:** Party is seen, but not attacked—infected townsfolk begin a slow, deliberate approach.
    
- **Full Failure:** See below... the infected attack, or something worse comes from the center of town.

# 🅱️ GOING THROUGH ZELBROSS

This route _feels faster_ but is more dangerous. It presents three **reveal scenes**, each layered with:

- Visual/body horror
    
- A potential encounter (based on rolls)
    
- Critical narrative clues
    

---

## 🧩 SCENE 1: THE STONE CRADLE (Crossroads)

> **Visual Framing:**  
> A man is crouched at the village well, unmoving. His hands are clasped, as if in prayer, body curled in the fetal position facing the well… but something’s wrong with how he’s bent.

### 🔍 Passive Observation:

- At distance: Looks like he’s weeping at the well.
    
- Up close: He’s **fused** to it—his **legs folded and melted into his torso**, spine arched backward unnaturally. The **skin on his back has bloomed open**, revealing pulsing gills that have begun **burrowing tendrils into the stone**.
    

### 🎲 Skill Triggers:

- **Stealth (DC 15):** Move past silently.
    
- **Insight (DC 13):** Realize he is still “aware”—eyes follow movement.
    
- **Failure Result:** He spasms violently, releasing a 10-ft cone of spore gas. All in cone make **CON save DC 15** or take 1d4 Infection Die + Disadvantage on next Wis/Int save.
    

---

## 🧩 SCENE 2: MERCHANT’S MARKET (Town Square)

> **Visual Framing:**  
> A merchant cart is overturned. A man’s body is **half-dragged beneath it**, twitching. The back legs kick weakly, as if something is still pulling from below—but nothing is visible.

### 🧠 Horror Beat:

- The man is **partially fused** with the cart’s undercarriage. Below the cobbles, tiny fungal tendrils are pulling his organs down _through the stones._
    
- If approached, the cart _shifts_ and a **pair of malformed fungal hands** erupt to drag another victim under.
    

### 🎲 Encounter:

- **Trigger:** On investigation or failed Stealth/Perception.
    
- **Enemies:** 2x Infected Townsfolk (CR 1/2) and 1x _Cobblespawn_ (custom fungal tentacle variant that animates from under the stones).
    
- Players may choose to run or try to save the victim (too late—they’re already dead).
    

---

## 🧩 SCENE 3: THE WELCOME ARCH (West Gate)

> **Visual Framing:**  
> A town guard is “standing watch” just inside the broken Zelbross arch. At first, he looks fine… until the party gets closer and sees **mushrooms where his eyes should be.**

### 😱 Reveal:

- The “guard” is dead and **propped up** with mycelium inside his armor like a puppet. It animates if players get within 10 feet.
    

### 🎲 Encounter:

- **Only triggers if:** PCs get too close or make noise.
    
- **Combat:** Fungal Guard (use Scout stats + immunity to poison, weak to radiant/fire).
    
- **Environmental Hazard:** Blooming fungus bursts from nearby signpost if disturbed (WIS Save DC 13 or short-term hallucination effect).
    

---

## 🔚 Endgame of Either Path:

Whether they sneak around or cut through:

- The players either **rendezvous with Tressa Holt** or are found by her as she’s desperately trying to get Mira & Nola to safety.
    
- Either way, the **cart escape sequence** will soon begin, followed by:
