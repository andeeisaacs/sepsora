Moss & Hide (Grayhall Residence and Storefront) Midnight Discovery**

> (Narrative Framing—read verbatim):  
> **Under the oppressive midnight sky, you quickly make your way to Moss & Hide, hoping the Grayhalls remain alive.**
> 
> **But as you near their home, you find it drastically transformed. Walls bulge outward, wrapped tightly in slick, gelatinous membranes pulsing with vein like structures as it moves liquid to and from everywhere it is seen.
> 
 A strange silence hangs here, broken only by faint, wet movements from inside. The back door stands slightly ajar, strands of dripping biofilm stretching across the opening like spider silk.**

## 🔍 **Immediate Scene Discovery (Clues & Observations):**

- **Calen’s Violent Explosion:**  
    Players immediately see evidence of a violent fungal eruption at the room's center, marking Calen as patient zero:
    
    - Splattered translucent slime moulde covering walls, ceiling, and floor.
        
    - Fungal growth radiating outward, creating grotesque, rapidly growing membranes.
        
- **Harlan’s Fate (Body Horror Reveal):**  
    Harlan Grayhall is partially fused into the inner wall:
    
    - Body grotesquely elongated, tendrils pulling limbs apart methodically.
        
    - His ribcage split open, internal organs carefully redistributed into surrounding membranes.
        
    - Face frozen mid-agony—eyes twitch reflexively, following movement without consciousness.
        
- **Signs of a Struggle:**  
    Evidence Mira and Nola barely escaped:
    
    - Furniture overturned, knife marks on walls, smeared blood trail leading out through the front, suggesting Mira and Nola fled toward Holt.

## 🎭 **Optional Reactive Encounter (Player-triggered):**

- **Membrane Node (Animated Hazard)**:  
    If players linger too long or significantly disturb the environment:
    
    - Portions of the fungal membrane animate, attempting to envelop intruders.
        
    - **Stats:** Use "Animated Armor" block, immune to poison/acid, vulnerable to fire/radiant damage.

His ribs splay open, organs carefully and methodically extracted, now pumping through the surrounding membranes. His slack-jawed face babbles meaningless, wet words, reflexively twitching toward sound or movement.** **The sight is something you can imagine is a stage of what Erel was going through in Calen's house**

The construct moves with an unsettling fluidity, slick and viscous, always reaching hungrily forward.**

## ⚙️ **Combat Encounter Notes:**

- Both creatures clearly demonstrate fungal efficiency and repurposing:
    
    - Harlan reveals a careful reorganization of human anatomy.
        
    - Membrane Node highlights fungal resourcefulness, pulling from multiple hosts.
        
- Players may clearly observe, interact with, or exploit the fungal behavior:
    
    - Fire, radiant, or lightning damage should be especially effective (remember campaign-wide vulnerability).
        
- Clearly adhere to body-horror aesthetics:
    
    - Slick, wet, gelatinous, organic textures.
        
    - Visible tissue rearrangement and hybrid biological surrealism.
