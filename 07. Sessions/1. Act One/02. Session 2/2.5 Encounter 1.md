### 🐺 Corrupted Wolves (possible 6 total, start with 2)

Each wolf has a unique fungal mutation. Base stats are CR 1/4 wolves, modified:

**Armor Class** 13  
**Hit Points** 19 (3d8 + 6)  
**Speed** 40 ft.

|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|13 (+1)|14 (+2)|15 (+2)|3 (–4)|12 (+1)|6 (–2)|

**Damage Immunities** Poison, Acid  
**Condition Immunities** Poisoned  
**Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 13  


#### Wolf 1: **Sporehowler**

- **Mutation:** The upper half of its skull is fused with a humanoid looking skull, as if somehow stitched together with the lower jaw of a wolf. 
    
- **Trait:** Once every other round, as a Bonus Action, it emits a horrible howl. All corrupted creatures within 120 ft are drawn toward the sound and act on initiative 0 next round.
    
- **Callout:** A reverbing, unnatural howl—layered with a wet fungal hiss beneath the canine cry mixxed with the sound of a humanoid man: "HEAWWLPP—"
    

#### Wolf 2: **Bonebloom**

- **Mutation:** Its ribcage is open, dragging vines of moldy intestines. Its lungs hang heavy, cradled by mycilic webbing. 
    
- **Trait:** When reduced to 0 HP, explodes in a 10 ft radius cloud. DC 13 DEX save or be covered in spores (1d4 infection).
    
- **Callout:** The body ruptures with a _wet POP_ followed by a hiss of escaping spores.
    

#### Wolf 3: **Glimmerhide**

- **Mutation:** Translucent fungal growths give it chameleon-like camouflage
    
- **Trait:** While in dim light or darkness, gains advantage on Stealth and first attack made from hiding deals +1d6 poison damage.
    
- **Callout:** Silent as it strikes, the camouflage flickers like wet glass catching moonlight. Not magic, but oddly alchemic. 
    

#### Wolf 4: **Triplegait** _(Reinforcement: triggered by howl)_

- **Mutation:** One front leg is missing; fungal tendrils help it limp unnaturally
    
- **Trait:** When it dashes, its fungal limbs release clouds of spores. Creatures it passes within 5 ft must succeed DC 12 CON save or gain +1 infection.
    
- **Callout:** "_Thmp-thmp-SKKRRR_" — the dragging slap of a limp gait splashing through mold and ash
    

#### Wolf 5: **Crawlmaw** _(Reinforcement: triggered by howl)_

- **Mutation:** Back legs and pelvis missing — drags itself forward with grotesque speed using forelimbs
    
- **Speed:** 20 ft crawl, considered prone so automatic advantage to hit.
    
- **Trait:** Immune to prone condition. If it successfully bites a prone target, the bite deals +1d6 necrotic damage.
    
- **Callout:** The rhythmic scraping of claws on wood, breathing harsh and wet, gurgling with each lunge.
    

#### Wolf 6: **Tanglehide** _(Reinforcement: triggered by howl)_

- **Mutation:** Entire body is knotted with mossy tendrils and brittle fungal limbs
    
- **Trait:** Melee attacks against it have disadvantage unless the attacker is within 5 ft (due to shifting mass). On death, it leaves behind a 10 ft radius patch of writhing tendrils (difficult terrain for 1 minute).
    
- **Callout:** Twitching limbs and whispered creaks — like many voices breathing through wood.

### 🦌 Corrupted Deer (Reinforcement, Round 3)

- **CR:** 1/8
    
- **HP:** 11 | AC: 14 | Speed: 60 ft
    
- **Trait:** Runs through the battlefield unpredictably. Each round, it moves 60 ft in a random direction. Creatures in its path must succeed DC 13 DEX save or be knocked prone.
    

**Mutation:** Exposed muscle and fungal antlers seeping toxic gas. The antlers have translucent tips; the one good eye remaining pulsates rapidly.

**Aura:** Creatures that end their turn within 5 ft gain +1 infection.

**Callout:** A shrill bleat, strangled and warped — "REEEEEK-KKHHHRRR" — echoes through the mist.

### **Traits**

**Fungal Hide.**  
When the corrupted cow takes fire, radiant, or lightning damage, it emits a low groan as spores release from ruptured fungal sacs. All creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or become exposed to infectious spores.

> _(Roll a secret 1d4 infection die for each failed save.)_

**Lumbering Bulk.**  
The cow doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving directly toward a creature it can see.

---

**Gore.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
**Hit:** 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 12 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone.

**Spore-Rich Bellow (Recharge 5–6).**  
The corrupted cow lets out a distorted, cavernous moo that vibrates with fungal resonance. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or take **4 (1d8)** poison damage and have **disadvantage on Wisdom checks** until the end of their next turn.

> _(For each creature that fails, roll a secret 1d4 infection die.)_

---

### 🌫️ Environmental Hazard: Spore Fog

- **Trigger:** Starts immediately due to explosion aftermath
    
- **Description:** Hissing clouds of fungal spores and smoke roll cover the sky. Visibility is reduced to 40 ft, and spores cling to wounds and lungs.
    

**Effect:**

- At the end of **each round**, every player not actively retreating or otherwise escaping gains **+ 1d4 infection** (secretly tracked)
    
- Any player examining the air (Nature or Arcana DC 15) can note fungal particulate and acid-like scent, they notice more closely their companions breathing it in. 
    

Optional cue: First person to threshold begins coughing blood or convulsing from exposure

**Callout:** A low, continuous _hiss_ punctuated by distant gurgles — "chhhhhhhhhkkk-KHHHK—hssssssss"

---

### 🏃 Player Escape Options

- **Retreat Path:** Back through forest path (best bet, but due to fallen silo and barn explosion debris it can be a bit harder to get to, considered difficult terrain)
---

### 🏱 Loot

- [[Calen’s Hunting Knife]]

- **Satchel snagged on a broken branch in the woods.
    
    - 1x Potion of Healing
          
    -  Thinly vine-bound field journal:
	    - first several pages note various mundane hunting life, 
	    - some notation of the forest seeming to smell stranger than normal, 
	    - a mention of wanting to explore the Star Mounts,
	    - A few pages regarding bringing shipment of goods to M&H for Holt. 
	    -  Discovery of a passage leading down to the Underdark. 
	    -  Outlining reports of strange occurrences. Farm animals having broken free and fleeing the farm. Most particular and documented is a final page explaining how a  Drow came to town, eyes pulsing, was first seen standing in the middle of the road in broad daylight (very odd). No weapons on him. Despite the Drow wearing typical lolth militarian garb, he did not show hostility and was mostly docile. Out of fear of it being a scout, though, they kept him in the barn. 
	    - Last entry was a day before Calen's regular shipment to B&H. 
	    
      If rolled higher: The back cover of the journal has a false lining, a thread hanging where if tugged, the lining off to reveal a boon card.
