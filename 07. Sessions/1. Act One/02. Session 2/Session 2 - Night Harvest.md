Picking up where Session 1 left off: Rolling initiative and gaining the 3rd level for their subclasses. They were told to roll initiative as the Fungal Corrupted Hill Giant creaked and groaned its way out of the collapsed house rubble. The wolves will be revealing themselves from behind Calen's house. If players do not leave the house immediately, the wolves can come in through windows to kind of 'push' the players out.


Prep TODO: 
- Assist players with their character sheet to level to 3.
- COMPLETE: Use [[2.5 Encounter 1]] for the encounter with the wolves, hill-giant and the other possible corrupted woodland creatures. 
- The first player to already reach their threshold is Johann, who has been gun-ho on trying to burn all of the fungus corruption.
- Build Corrupted Cow stat-block.
- Build out Murmuration awakening for Pact of the Blade.
- Build out Arcturus's Patron, Kronos's interest in the new corruption as he appeared momentarily to him as they entered the town. 
- Build out 2-3 small encounters in Zelbross
- Build out Zelbross in ruins.
-  Build out Cart travel
	- Build out Nola telling the story of what happened up till her fleeing to find Tess, who came and witnessed Mira performing the death blow on Harlan.
	- Build out Mira succumbing to her fatal injuries
	- Build out the environment- The sky is alight with fires, blooms in the air. They are not outrunning it, they are catching up to it. 
	- Possible encounter?
	- Long rest on the cart. 
- Build out Secomber, the first stop in travel on the cart.
	- Meet with authorities
		- Discover information about Drows coming out of the forest.
			- They have one 
		- Reports of twisted animals and a hill giant onslaught on the town to the north, Ulvil. 



- The players will need to flee the battle. We do not want to kill them but we want to be pushing them out of the village back towards the path to Zelbross they came by.
	- Once the players break the tree-line of the High Forest and can see Zellbross they will be met with the trading hub/settlement in the midst of chaos due to the spread of the Myconid spore 'infection' taking over.
	- Try to get around the town from the outskirts, which depending on if they keep a wide berth or stay close, they will run into [[Tressa Holt]] by her finding them, or them coming upon her attempting to flee the town, she will beckon them to get on the cart. 
	- Enter the town, and be grabbed by [[Tressa Holt]], wanting to get them to her cart that had arrived a short time ago, but they will need to travel through the camp to get to the cart.
- Once on the cart, find Mira and Nola stashed in the back trying to keep low and fleeing with the players.

# Pre-session WARM-UP
---

In character- 

- What is the first thing someone would notice about you?
    
- What about your clothes, gear, or bearing shows who you _used_ to be?
    
- What sound do your footsteps make when walking down a gravel road?
    
- What smell follows you?
    
- Do you think you would stick close to someone when entering a dungeon hallway you've never explored before? 
	- Would you take charge, or walk two abreast?  
	- Perhaps you'd guard the rear?
	- Hang back in the previous room until the all clear is given?
    
- What are you doing with your hands while walking?
    
- How do you feel about silence? When noone is talking, do you pipe up? How do you do it?
# Last session recap
---

> After crossing the Greypeak Mountains and awakening at your camp you traveled down the road you've traversed countless times with the sam, the party followed a lead on a missing shipment tied to Holt and the Grayhall family business. Their investigation led them through eerily quiet woods and into the nestled away village of Brindlewild—where a strange growth or corruption has taken hold.
> 
> The village residents seemingly being 'claimed' or some-sort of grotesque assimilation with the dwellings and land. The village itself gently moving, breathing and overgrown-  pulsing with a type of life. 
> 
> Some of you found it fascinating, some of you were repulsed.  Some of you tried to divine what this is, with little or no success. Some of you saw it as a reason to cleanse the area, although ill-advised. But you remembered your task, to find Calen and young Erel.  You located the apparent dwellings of Calen and finally… the body of young Erel Grayhall, fused to the ceiling of abode. Not dead, but certainly not alive in any traditional sense. 
> 
> Then, distant howls growing closer.
> 
> A cracking of crust and the twisting of wood.  
> 
> Then a malformed shape of a **hill giant** wielding a partial tree trunk as a makeshift club rose from the neighboring ruined building as various twisted shapes of woodland animals started to close in on the backside of Calens house. 
> 
> And then…

# The Crooked One 
---

>The 20 foot hill giant risin, rotting fungus, mushroom falling from him with plumes of dusty spores being agitated into flight, but **something happens for you and only you Arcturus.** 

>As you ready yourself to fight alongside your companions you've come to know and trust you notice it- its a smell that rises above the sweet and sickly honey corruption scent that permeates the area. 


> This smell is the smell you are intimately familiar with. Its that damp burnt meat smell. Your facial burn scar tissue starts to ache. 

> All while this is happening to you- the world around you slows down to a creeping pace. The smoke and plumes of fungal dust once dancing on the wind stops in place. All movement from everything and everyone but you holds in suspended animation.

>Without a doubt, you know it now. 
>It's **Him**. He's **here**.  


*Using dark low drawl character voice*, broken- **GMAN**: 
> Tsk Tsk, ***Arcturus***. Almost died.. *again*... I see. 

> You know, the last time we spoke, I found you in a similar situation.. 

>  Letting someone you trusted of your.. court.. making movements to send you to a charred grave

When looked at, he is hard to focus on, its like your eyes want to divert away. Like forcing your eyes to stay open when looking at the sun, but you can see him raise a hand and pointing a single finger at Johann, referencing to his general direction lazily as he walks forward and under him. 

>  That's just bad form, ***Elderflower***.  We need you in... much better shape if we are to execute on our *contractual* obligations.  

You feel the knowledge of new power entering your mind, your patron granting you new abilities you didnt have mere moments ago. You feel stronger, able to withstand the pain a bit more, and dish it out.  (This is your level up to 3.)


>Do try to survive.. whatever this (*once again gesturing, now broadly to the scene before you of the growths and corruption*).. is. 
>
>But I do have to say, It is most fascinating, I can feel it trying to resist me right now. Like its aware.  Like it thinks it can bend the will of my domain, time, as easily as it bends life. 


> And little Deepwater? Do be more cautious. I do loathe when people squander *my gifts*.

Everything resumes in time. 

**Start "Slay the Spire soundtrack"**
## **ROLL INITIATIVE!!!!!!!!**
---
**Note: Arcturus rolled nat20** (Double check rules on that.)
Run [[2.5 Encounter 1]]
Play "Slay the Spire soundtrack"
**IF TPK IS IMMINENT:**

Ordering the Spore— Infection-Stirred Distraction**

**Trigger:** If a player has reached milestone threshold, have the giant and the other woodland animals stop attacking, the ruined village houses all wheeze out plumes of spores into the air, making visibility -and re-prioritize an invisible and silent signal to ignore the players and move back into the forest. 

**Effect:** It’s not mercy—it’s priority. Something worse is calling them.  

> “The giant’s pulls his arm up, ready to slam down and crush you but suddenly halts mid-swing. Then, all at once, the creatures turn their attention away—like hounds catching a stronger scent, or a silent whistle being blown, they all immediately turn towards the nearby woods and start hastfully departing into the tree obscurities”

---
# The Path Back

> The silence swells, not as peace, but as pressure. The kind that settles behind the eyes and between the ribs. Every breath feels borrowed. Every glance behind you, a risk. You survived, but barely.  

*Ask the party for a table perception check. **DC 10**

> Just within a few minutes of walking back onto the path that brought you to Brindlewild, it catches your eye. You see it *this time*, Hanging from a low, snapped branch just ahead — swaying slightly in the cold air — is a **satchel**. 
>
>Worn leather, the stitching frayed at the edges, an embossing in the corner bearing the faint design of a small bow and knife.
>
It was here when you passed this way before, but now you can see it because it was on the wrong side of the tree. 

>The strap is torn, not cut. The break looks fresh, And there's a faint smudge of rust-colored residue across the top flap.

>As you draw closer, the satchel catches the light like a sheen — not a metal glint. A thin layer of pale yellow dust clings to the torn leather *like pollen*. 

>The forest doesn’t react. The satchel just waits, turning slowly in the smoke and dust heavy air of the High Forest.

*Once the player grabs the satchel:
> The dust breaks free from the treated animal hide leather, hovering in the moonlight for just a moment before blowing away into the forest. 


[[Calen's Satchel]]

# Continue: Returning to Zelbross
----

**(Survival DC 14)**  
Tracks and bent foliage confirm a figure moved swiftly, but unsure footedly, through here recently, falling on and off the path before the tracks dissappear into the dense forest heading south, south west.

**(Survival DC 18)**  
What you find interesting, is there are a lot of various creatures foot prints, all overlaping eachother, each of them crossing the path but this particular set is fresher than the rest, and moving in a different direction. 


** Johann's nose starts to drip something wet. Warm. Blood. Roll on [[🦠 Infection Tracker – Sepsora Campaign (DM-Only)]]]

# Reaping the Harvest
---


Break from tree line of the high forest back to [[Zelbross]]
	-the night sky has low clouds obstructing the moon.. or is that smoke. Its a haze that is lit from the ground. Fires, but not of camp, or of torches. Of the various merchant carts and tents and rebuilt establishments.
	- Distant screams, sounds of running and various window glass breaking and the 'FWOOM' of fires spreading to new accellerants, are heard. 
	- The settlement is once again crumbling to ruins. The fires flickering on walls cast shadows of fighting. 
	  
What Do you Do?

# Through Zelbross

- If players immediately go to Moss and Hide, have [[Tressa Holt]] show up quickly, looking for them and try to guide them out to the west exit where her cart has been waiting to depart in the morning.  Explain in short what happened in their absence: 

- **Calen** returned, different, in a daze. 
	- Eventually attacked **Harlan**, and when **Harlan** defended, **Calen** burst into spores.
- **Harlan**, having been the closest person to **Calen**, collapsed, went unconscious for awhile, stood up and started acting strange as well. After some time, he attacked **Mira** and while defending she told Nola to get Tess. 
- While gone, Mira became mortally wounded by Harlan (large gash in her side, rib exposed, but not bleeding much) 
- Harlan's corpse, after a short period, started melding into the ground, skin ruptured and started to spread out like an rapidly mobile slime mould.

### Encounter 1 — Northern Quarter: _Family Torn Apart_

**Set-Up:**  
As you approach the familiar northern quarter, screams puncture the eerie quiet. Outside a modest house, a corrupted humanoid—once an elderly man—looms over two terrified villagers, his torso ruptured with fungal tendrils that lash wildly, reaching for them. 

**Enemies:**

- **Corrupted Elder** (Commoner stats with added fungal tendril attack: +3 to hit, 1d4 bludgeoning +1 poison damage)
    

**Scene Details:**

- One victim is already fallen, partially merged with fungal growth.
    
- A second villager is cornered, pleading for help.
    
- The corrupted elder is slow, awkwardly moving, driven by unnatural instincts.


What happened:

If the players decided to enter town, have Tess try to guide them through while explaining what has happened while they were gone. 


- **Calen** returned, different, in a daze. 
	- Eventually attacked **Harlan**, and when **Harlan** defended, **Calen** burst into spores.
- **Harlan**, having been the closest person to **Calen**, collapsed, went unconscious for awhile, stood up and started acting strange as well. After some time, he attacked **Mira** and while defending she told Nola to get Tess. 
- While gone, Mira became mortally wounded by Harlan (large gash in her side, rib exposed, but not bleeding much) 
- Harlan's corpse, after a short period, started melding into the ground, skin ruptured and started to spread out like an rapidly mobile slime mould.
