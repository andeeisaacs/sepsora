> In the wake of your desperate battle, the oppressive silence is punctuated only by your own ragged breathing and the distant, muffled sounds of Zelbross succumbing to its chaos. You each glance around, painfully aware of Johann and Arcturus's absence—one fled north, vanishing into the looming darkness of the High Forest, the other inexplicably disappeared out front amid the horrors now claiming the town.
> 
> Zugusdeit, your wounds still raw from the battle and your neck festering, you feel the throbbing pustules in your throat as Jinn struggles to hear clearly, her ears now hollowed and gone, replaced with hollow holes with a type of yellow slim mould gently moving and caressing the outside skin from within the canals of your skull , as if reaching for purchase to grip but never finding it. 

> Johann's sudden flight has left bitterness lingering among you, a heavy burden as tangible as the fungal stench permeating Moss and Hide, which you notice is far more overgrown than the rest of the town in view, allowing you to surmise this likely was ground zero for the calamity Zellbross is in.

**_(Pause briefly for player reactions or interactions.)_**

### 🎤 **Holt's Arrival (read verbatim):**

> Suddenly, hurried footsteps echo from the front of the shop, heavy and deliberate, crunching through debris and filth. A silhouette fills the doorway—an outline of something or someone standing and peering out from within. 
> 

# ***What do you do?***

 **(read verbatim):**
>Holt steps into view, her face pale and strained, her eyes wide with urgency and confusion.  Drops of blood have left streaks across her face, her forearm bandaged but a red hue seeping through the cloth. 

>She freezes, staring in shock at Harlan's corrupted, lifeless body sprawled grotesquely across the ground. Though dead, you can see the tendrils of overgrowth reaching for it as various parts of his body twitch in the afterdeath. 

> "By the gods," she mutters, voice trembling. Her gaze snaps to each of you in rapid succession, searching for answers. "What in the *nine hells* happened here? Is this, thing..  Harlan?"

> Holt: "Mira and Nola came running, half-crazed, babbling about Calen's return and.. exploding, and Harlan... changing. I—I had to see for myself."

> Holt approaches cautiously, sidestepping pulsing fungal growths as she kneels briefly beside Harlan’s twisted form, clearly overcome by grief and disbelief.

### 🎤 **Fungal Reclamation (read verbatim):**

> A wet, slithering noise rises from the taller grass just beyond the broken rear threshold. As you glance toward the sound, you see Harlan’s detached arm—severed at the shoulder—being slowly pulled backward by thin tendrils of mold weaving through the overgrowth. The movement is unsettlingly precise, like nerves still firing despite death. No matter what you do, the growth has it, and within seconds it vanishes into the dark.
> 
> But something glints in the grass where the arm once lay. Nestled in the wet earth, half-sunken but unmistakable, is a bronze wedding band.

Provide the player [[Harlan’s Wedding Band]] 

### **Scene Details & Roleplay Prompts:**

- Holt is visibly shaken and confused by the scale and rapidity of the fungal corruption.
    
- She will ask pointed questions about Johann and Arcturus’s whereabouts, becoming deeply concerned when told they’re missing.
    
- Holt explains briefly how she left Mira and Nola safely near her carts at the town's western gate. She emphasizes the need to leave immediately as Zelbross is quickly becoming overwhelmed.
    

### 🗣️ **Holt's Key Dialogue Prompts:**

- "I don't know what madness has been unleashed, but it's spreading faster than anything I've ever seen. This is.. unprecidented"
    
- "**Mira and Nola**—they’re safe for now. We have to move quickly and get to them before there's nowhere left to go."
    
- *(**If questioned about Johann)*** "I didn't see him out front, just that—that thing at the well. Gods, it's all gone to rot."
    
- ***(About Arcturus)*** "I saw no sign of him, but the forest has a way of hiding things—and people—when it wants to."

### 🎲 **Immediate Next Steps (Transition):**
- Once players resolve immediate questions or roleplay with Holt, swiftly move them toward exiting Moss and Hide.
    
- Highlight urgency: distant screams, buildings collapsing, and increasingly aggressive fungal manifestations occurring around them as they flee.
    
- Provide immediate prompts for skill checks (Group Stealth or Athletics) to navigate quickly through Zelbross and reach the caravan safely.


## Embarking through Zellbross

 > You step into Zelbross beneath the oppressive midnight sky. The familiar streets are now twisted nightmares—walls ripple with gelatinous moulde, glistening like wet muscle. Buildings lean at unnatural angles, as though breathing deeply in slow, rhythmic pulses. A sickening scent of rot and mold fills your senses, and faint movement flickers at the edge of your vision. Ahead, the quickest route to Holt’s cart leads straight through this corrupted heart.

## 🕳️ **Scene 1: The Stone Cradle ( Infront of Moss and Hide)**

### 🎤 **Narrative Reveal (read verbatim):**

> down the street from Moss and Hide, towards the crossroads, you spot the old stone well. A single figure crouches oddly atop the well rim, motionless and bent forward at an impossible angle that would cause them to fall into the well if not held by something.
>  His arms and legs are grotesquely elongated, slick tendrils spreading from his open back across their skin and where you can see through what ribs remain from behind, his lungs and heart being squeezed by the growths, pumping blood and oxygen through the body. 
>  
>  Where some disks in his spin were once, now has vine like and slick tendrils having meticulously embedded themselves into the stones of the wall having found nooks and 
>  crannies for it to creep into.
>  
> He shudders softly, and with his head bent forward as though looking into the well, something thick and viscous drips slowly from his slack jaw and falls into the well. 

### 🔍 **Scene Details & Checks:**

- **Passive Insight (no roll required):** The figure is alive, actively being converted into fungal infrastructure. His twitching eyes dart between each one of you.

| Action                 | Check (DC)                          | Consequence on Fail                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Quietly move past      | Group Stealth (DC 15)               | Alerts the figure, triggering Spore Burst attack |
| Examine growth closely | Nature (DC 15)                      | Trigger fungal retaliation (Spore Burst)         |
| Mercy kill or disturb  | No check, auto-triggers Spore Burst |                                                  |

## 🛒 **Scene 2: Merchant's Market (Town Square)**

### 🎤 **Narrative Reveal (read verbatim):**

> The town square has become a nightmarish spectacle. A merchant’s overturned cart sits partially sunken into slimy cobblestones. At its base, a man writhes weakly, his body dissolving through the stone into an unseen mass below.  Tress gasps and cusses under her breath, pointing at the man, explaining that this is one of her two drivers and carts, 
> 
> The street ripples subtly, something massive lurking just beneath the surface, reshaping human limbs and animal bones into new, unsettling configurations.

### 🔍 **Scene Details & Checks:**

- **Environmental storytelling:** Players clearly see fungal efficiency repurposing the merchant into organic material for a hidden construct beneath the stones.
    

|Action|Check (DC)|Consequence on Fail|
|---|---|---|
|Carefully bypass cart area|Group Acrobatics (DC 13)|Alert hidden threat beneath|
|Rescue merchant (futile)|Investigation (DC 14)|Disturb slime lurker (combat starts immediately)|
|Discern fungal purpose|Medicine/Nature (DC 15)|Misinformation causes hesitation or panic|

**Reactive Threat:**

- **"Slime Lurker"**
    
    - Use **Membrane Node stats**  from [[3. Session Three]] 
        
    - Attacks from beneath cobblestones, visibly forming new limbs mid-combat.

### **Approaching the Cart (read verbatim):**

> As you round the final corner toward the western gate, the thundering sound of a struggle breaks through the crackling ruin. The last remaining cart—a two-horse wagon—sits at a hard angle beside the gate. Mira and Nola are fighting fiercely to hold their ground. Three corrupted villagers, bodies sagging and partially torn, lurch forward with twitching, fungal aggression.
> 
> The drivers stumbles, blood gushing from a wound in his side. As he raises his arms in a final act of defense, a peasant seizes his neck with a crushing snap, then leans down to the torn throat and exhales a thick spore filled mist into the open wound. His body begins to jerk and swell grotesquely—the infection taking root even before he hits the ground.

> Mira parries a blow, gracefully and skillfully sidestepping her enemies tendrils lashing out at her, deftly throwing a dagger from her hand into the neck of her foe causing it to collapse to the ground
> 
> —but the corrupted villager that had just brutally ended the drivers life attacks her with claws from behind with shocking speed, raking across her lower back. You hear the wet snap of bones breaking and flesh tearing open. She gasps sharply, then staggers, her blood instantly turning her once white, albeit dirty, blouse soaking with shades of carmine and sanguine.

> Nola, having clocked out of the corner of her eye screams, spinning toward her mother just in time to see Mira reel and stagger to the side towards the cart. Her eyes flare wide with horror, then something else—rage.
> 
> With a snarl, she drives her blade through the eye socket of the peasant she’d been fighting, then turns, in the same motion pulling the blade from the socket  and rams it a second time into the chest of the one threatening Mira.

> Mira staggers, reaching out and grasping onto the cart, within mere seconds you can see the ground below her pooling with blood and Mira's face becoming pale and blue. Nola grabs her by the shoulders, hauling her up with all the strength her frame can manage. "We have to go—NOW!" she screams, blood streaking her face.

> Tressa Holt leaps onto the driver’s bench, seizing the reins. "Get on!" she bellows. "We’re not dying here!" the sound of inumerable foot steps, once walking now running 

### 🎯 **Urgency & Combat Notes:**

- Players arrive just in time to clean up the remaining threat—treat it as a cinematic final round where their involvement ensures success.
    
- Emphasize that the cart _must_ leave within moments—lingering means more infected will overrun the area.
    

### 🚩 **Player Objective:**

- Finish off the remaining corrupted peasants.
    
- Get onto the cart with Holt, Mira, and Nola.
    

### 🎲 **Escape Sequence:**

- On boarding the cart, describe the horses surging forward, the wheels lurching into motion, and Zelbross beginning to collapse entirely behind them.
    
- Use skill checks (Athletics to leap aboard, ranged attacks from moving cart if desired, etc.) as transitional flavor.
