# Opening

_Morning breaks over your campsite just outside of the **northern pass** of the **Greypeak Mountains**, a pass you've come to know through your travels together as a lesser known shortcut, cutting your travel time down significantly compared to the common route through the middle of the mountains that is favored by travelers, merchants and bandits alike.


You took camp last night just on the western exit, after your party made it out of the pass, along the edge of a several hundred foot drop sheer cliff.  Easily defensible thanks to only a single ingress- and obscured by boulders and brush growth from the foot path just a few feet away. 

*The faint scent of last night's embers lingers on the crisp air, curled around your gear, tent and bedrolls like the essence a fading dream.*  

Optional: ==_(Arcturus)_ — The embers remind you of something else: a scent twisted with memory. Somewhere, far back, the Crooked One stirred in similar smoke, but that smoke smelled more of a certain type of charred meat. 

_One by one, you wake, stirring from your dreams to the warm light of daybreak as it is cast on your face and the chirps of birds. Someone nudges the next, a quiet chain reaction rousing of strange, unlikely group of a tight nit party of adventurers. 

bound by familiarity and as a way to not alarm the other. Before long, you’re breaking camp — folding tents, wrapping up bedrolls and kicking dirt over dying coals, adjusting straps and cloaks for the long road ahead._

_Today marks the beginning of the end of your **tenday** journey **west** — toward the Sword Coast’s crown jewel, **Waterdeep**. There, you'll sell your hard-won goods, replenish supplies, chase rumors, check in with guilds, family, and friends... and maybe if you haven't spent your newly acquired gold on booze and chasing various tail, you'll afford a real bed for a night or two._

**(Offer a single player a DC10 Nature check.

If successful, they catch the faintest, strange undertone on the breeze — the sharp and earthy yet fleeting scent of something they cant exactly make out. The smell is so brief that its hard to tell if you actually even smelled it.

Make note of their success: This hint grants them an automatic success later when investigating the overtaken village.)**

_(Zugusdeit)_ — If she succeeds, the scent triggers a half-memory, as if she's smelled this in a dream before.



#### **If players ask about surroundings:**
---

- _To the south lies **Orlbar** — a glorified waystation hugging the southern pass of the Greypeak Mountains. It would mean detouring southeast, away from the road to Waterdeep._
    
- _To the **north**, the dense, ancient boughs of the High Forest loom. The woods are thick, wild, and without a clear path, not a tempting option for travelers without purpose._

---

_You shoulder your packs and set off down the path. The lesser taken trail that has led you through the northern part of the Greypeaks stretches before you down the foothills— a dusty ribbon trail winding between rocky hills, the mountains shrinking behind you with each step that leads you just out beyond the town of **Loudwater**, and onto the known **Delimbiyr Route**. The route that will eventually bring you to The Sword Coast and your Waterdeep destination_. In your travels together, you found that this route has cut down on your travel time by skipping the whole of Loudwater, an overly zealot in the religious sense, town you've learned to just avoid if you can. 

_As you walk, the rhythmic crunch of boots on gravel fades to the background... and your mind drifts.  Not to the road ahead — but to a road once traveled.  

A moment when you, (First character name) first realized you could trust (Character Name) with your life._  

_(Begin baton-passing flashback sequence here.)_

## Entering Zelbross


*... As you come out of your memory, your legs still moving you subconsciously forward, the entrance to the ruined town you've all passed through before in your travels, its once glorious and welcoming archway welcome sign forces your eyes to glance up at it 

"**Zelbross**" it reads, in faded and peeling paint. A once bustling and promising settlement that lays ruined from wars of past turned makeshift trading outpost. 

*Due to the route passing through it, the river passing along it, the clay pools it offers and being the halfway mark between Loudwater and Secomber, it eventually became the perfect spot for merchants and travelers to stop and trade goods before setting off.*


*As you continue your journey on the route that travels down the middle of the town, you take note of the various merchant tents among the ruins of what was once the people of Zelbross' homes and businesses. The merchants taking these now empty spaces and filling it with open chests and tables with goods on display.* 

*You also take notice to the lighter than usual amount of foot traffic than you've seen in the past. A few less children playing, which depending on how you view it, may mean less worry about your coin purse becoming a bit lighter. 

There is a few less adventurers perusing the markets vendors as well but what really catches your eye is that seemingly placed anywhere that would fit to be within eye-line, are large handmade posters displaying a message written in common "**SCOUTING GROUP NEEDED IMMEDIATELY: EASY AND HIGH PAY! INQUIRE WITH HOLT!."* 

#### **If the players don't decide to look into the quest, have Tressa Holt notice them as they are passing through and flag them down.**



---
## The Merchant:  [[Tressa Holt]]

> _You spot the merchant by the edge of the market square— a tall, slightly broad-shouldered woman leaning against several stacked crates, markings on the outside indicating pottery, shells, statuettes, etc. Her eyes scanning the square like she’s keeping inventory on everything that breathes._
> 
> _She wears a thick coat of ash-gray suede, cut high at the collar, with sleeves rolled to the elbow to show toned forearms and rings of old burn scars along her wrists. Her hair is pulled into tight braids, streaked with deep russet and ivory, cascading down one side like a coil of rope._
> 
> _She has tusks — not large, but clear — marking her as half-orcish, though the precision of her speech and the sharpness in her eyes suggest she’s been in enough cities to know when to bark and when to barter._

> _There’s a ledger tucked in one belt pouch, a skinning knife with a worn wooden handle in the other, and not a trace of patience on her face. She makes eye contact with you and her eyes widen just a bit more, like spotting a gem in the dirt, 

Optional: ==_(Johann)_ — Holt eyes your flair with mild disdain. You get the feeling she’s sized up sailors before, and not kindly.==

Optional: ==_(Arcturus)_ — She doesn't flinch when she sees you. That alone makes her notable.==

**Tressa will need to ask questions to find out the players are heading towards Waterdeep or they have to divulge that information before she offers the ride on the shipment carriage to Waterdeep.**

### The Quest
> _“The shipment I’m here to pick up was supposed to come from a shop, Moss & Hide, over in the northern quarter. Local family — hard workers, reliable through and through the years I've worked with them. They handle trade on my shipment from a small settlement in the forest.”_

> _“But when I showed up yesterday to Moss & Hide to collect my shipment, their doors were closed. Which never happens.”_

> _“I banged until someone answered. Mira, the mother,— tired eyes, worried face — she told me her brother hadn’t come in with the usual delivery. And then that her son... went looking.”_

> _“That was three days ago.”_

> _“I don’t think they’ll turn down help if you offer. And if you can bring anything back — the shipment, answers, good or bad,  — I’ll pay you well **(if known where the players are going:  "and get you on that caravan to Waterdeep.")** But I need to know something before this wagon rolls out tomorrow. 
> 
> Oh, and if they try to offer you gold, tell them Holt said to just focus on their family, I'll be the one paying you the coin. All six hundred of it. ”_

**If the players question whats in the shipment**
"What is it in the shipment? None of your fuckin' business to be honest. The only thing you need to be concerned with is finding out what happened to it and why its not here. Look, youll get paid"

**Holt will direct them to the northern quarter to a shop named Moss & Hide**

----
## Exterior of Moss and Hide:

The shop is ontop of rebuilt ruins of the **old** **Zelbross**. The ruins acts as the foundation (old stone building with newer wood and new stone piled ontop of the old and the roof is newly rebuilt) a modest shop with a smaller front of house for customers, while the back acts as living area for the family. 
## Interior of Moss & Hide:

- The shop is quiet. Smells of leather oil, tanned hide, and something earthy — truffles, probably.
    
- Wooden counter near the front, racks of leather goods, wood-carved goods, and baskets with spiced earthen grown produce such as potatoes, truffles of various types and even some Elven specialties.
    
- In the back, sounds of light hammering or scraping: someone working.

Optional: ==_(Zugusdeit)_ — As you enter, the aroma of herbs and tanning oils reminds you of the person who raised you — fleeting, but anchoring.== 
Optional: ==_(Hams)_ — You instinctively scan for traps or hidden storage. Old habits from the road.==

---
### **Mira Grayhall (Wood Elf mother):**

> _Mira carries herself with type of quiet strength — tall, slender, younger looking than she actually is with sun-darkened olive skin and silver-flecked auburn hair tied back in a leather cord. Her eyes are a calm, leaf-green, above sharp cheekbones, but they flick toward the door every few minutes, as if always expecting someone to walk through it._

### **Nola Grayhall (Half-Elf Daughter, early 20s):**

> _Nola wears a leather apron stained with truffle dust and tanning oil. She has Mira’s sharp cheekbones and Harlan’s quiet intensity. Her long dark hair is braided back tightly, and she works with precise, focused movements — keeping herself busy like it’s the only thing keeping her from unraveling._.

## 🧩 Dialogue

### 🗣️ **Mira Grayhall Greets Them**:

>  *As you open the door to the shop, a bell gently jingles as the door hits it, catching the attention of a tall, slender, woman with sun-darkened olive skin and silver-flecked auburn hair that is tied back with a leather cord. 
>  
>  She turns her head sharply to look at you with something more than excitement for a new customer, its almost like she is expectant of someone, but then a subtle type of sadness washes over her face, quickly forced away into a poorly rehearsed customer service mask. Her eyes scans each one of your faces.*
>
>  ***Mira**: "Sorry, we're closed. That door was supposed to be locked..  "*
>  
>  *Before she can finish her sentence, she is interrupted by a young adult woman also behind the counter, her back towards all of you but has her head turned towards the older woman, giving a clear view of her **Elven** heritage that the point in her ears provides.* 
>  
>  ***Nola**: "Sorry, mom, my fault.. I just figured we should keep the shop open in case..."**
>  ***Mira**: "It's alright **Nola**, I appreciate it."*
>  
>  ***Nola** resumes stocking the shelves with product, tiding the display of goods. The older woman looks at you-* 
>  **Mira**: _“.. you don't look like you're here to purchase hides or truffles. You with **Holt? ”_  

==_(Zugusdeit)_ — Mira meets your eyes with quiet understanding — not pity. It’s subtle, but you recognize it as the look of someone who’s survived worse than she speaks of.==

***after confirmation from the players**
_“Holt's a good woman, a loyal customer, and even better friend. Better than most. Said she'd be sending someone by.”_*
> She drops the customer service facade, "I'm **Mira**. That's, **Nola**, my daughter, and in the back is **Harlen**, my husband. ”_   she gestures vaguely to the opening in the wall behind the counter, where a curtain hangs to provide semblance of privacy and division. 

 *In the back of the shop, sunlight beams in through an open back door. The sound of an axe can be heard chopping wood. Then a dull thud of said axe being dropped into the soil followed by footsteps walking in through the door. A large male figure can be half-seen behind the curtains that gently sway from the breeze and provide glimpses. He's sitting down at a tanners frame now, starting to work on a hide that has been stretched.* 

> _ **Mira**: “My brother, **Calen** brings **Holt's** goods from **Brindlewild, where he lives.  A bit inside the southern part of **The High Forest**. We share profits since he brings Holt's shipment specifically and- well..”_  
> 
> **She pauses for a moment, letting her gaze shift from who she's speaking with to a window in the foreground over their shoulder**
> 
> _“He should’ve been here four days ago. Its only a half days journey from there, but he didn't show. Nor did any word. Its not like him." 

**Mira gives a sharp inhale,** 
> "My son, **Erel**, left three days back to check on him. He didn’t say much, but he had that look — the one he gets when he's determined about something. Same look he gets when he knows he's about to be told no. But he left in the morning before we opened shop. Took his leather cloak and the bow his uncle gave him.”_

**_(She pauses to keep her voice steady.)_**  
> _“No one’s come back from that way in days. No new carts, no hunters, no foragers. No travelers like you.”_

> _“... please. Just tell us if you find them. And if you don’t...”_

> **_(She trails off, swallows, and forces a smile.)_**  
> _“**Holt** said not to pay you. Said we should keep the coin. Said we might need it. I’m not sure I like that... but I understand. She's being kind by not demanding the shipment of truffles to be compensated or letting us pay you directly.”_

**If players show kindness, or manage a skill check success- Mira will offer them each to take anything they want in lieu of coin**.
(Loot table needed here that is appropriate for the player levels and the theme of the shop.)

## Directions to Brindlewild

🗣️ **Mira Provides the directions via family trail shortcut:

> _“Head north straight towards the forest edge. You can head out the back door. At the edge of the trees, there’s an old **cairn** by brother set up years ago — moss-covered, weathered. That’s your marker.”_  

> _“Go straight into the woods behind the cairn. The path’s not carved, more of a desire line you need to look for, but it’s there. **Calen** never used the route through **Uluvin** , the ones travelers use— said they wasted half a day.”_  _“If you hit the river, you’ve gone too far and missed **Brindlewild**.”_



---
### **Nola Grayhall (Half-Elf Daughter, early 20s):**

> _Nola wears a leather apron stained with truffle dust and tanning oil. She has Mira’s sharp cheekbones and Harlan’s quiet intensity. Her long dark hair is braided back tightly, and she works with precise, focused movements — keeping herself busy like it’s the only thing keeping her from unraveling._

- _“He said I shouldn’t go. Said one of us needed to stay here. Told him dad would be pissed and he'd worry mom...” **brief pause** “I should’ve gone with him.” 

- *"If you go, look for signs of him. He always leaves subtle hints like a tree marking, a message or the likes in case he's ever in trouble later. Something his uncle taught him to do when hunting alone."*

---
### **Harlan Grayhall( Human father):**

> _Harlan is broad-shouldered and sun-leathered, with crow’s feet around sharp eyes and a thick salt-and-pepper beard. His hands are wide and thick with calluses, stained with oils and dyes, and he moves with the weight of someone who doesn’t waste time — even when the world’s giving him reasons to stop._


**If the players question Harlan, or if they set out without talking to him, have Harlan catch up, offer some supplies, say below and immediately walk away back to what he was doing at the shop after saying the following.**

 **_(Harlan stops working for just a second, runs up with a satchel over his shoulder and staring down at the tool in his hand like he forgot what he was doing.)_**
 
> _"Listen, Calen’s not some wandering fool. He’s a provider. Hunter, gatherer — damn good at both."_

> _"He’s been making the trip from Brindlewild to here every seven days for the last eleven years. Rain, wind, sickness — doesn’t matter. Always showed up with a full pack and a smart ass mouth."_v
  
> _"I don't know if he left the settlement or not, or if bandits caught up to him or he tried to take on an animal too big for him.. but he should’ve been here five days ago. My son adores him, wants to be just like him one day.. its why he took off to look for his gods damn uncle without saying a word to me or Mira, strong willed and smart. Knew we'd say no. "_

> **_(A pause. His voice is even, but a little quieter.)_**  
> _"Man like Calen doesn’t just disappear. Same goes for my son. 
> Look, If you cant bring them both home, just.. bring me answers at least."_

Optional: ==_(Hams)_ — Harlan’s pragmatism mirrors your own. When he talks about Calen’s reliability, it pings something in your mind-  It kind of clicks, that this is the kind of man you respect.==

*** **Harlan** un-shoulders a satchel and holds it out.*** 
	"For your travels."
**(Loot table of what he provides the players here if he runs up to talk to them)**

# The High Forest

*Your journey north to the forest line is uneventful, and before long , one of you notices a cairn, just as Mira described.  Moss covered and small, sits between and in-front of two trees. Had you not been looking for it you and at the angle you approached, it would have easily been overlooked along with the passage between the two trees that offers you hidden ingress*

# **Journey to Brindlewild – Mood and Mechanics**

### 🎧 **Atmosphere as they enter the woods:**

- Once players pass the cairn and begin moving into the forest proper, describe a **sudden drop in ambient sound**:
    
    - No birds.
        
    - No insects.
        
    - Just wind through the canopy and the occasional creak of an old tree.
        
    - Footsteps feel loud. Breathing feels loud. It's unnatural.

> _“ After about twenty to thirty minutes of walking single file into the forest, over overgrown tree roots, past brush, descending and ascending the various plateaus- The deeper in you walk, the quieter the world becomes — an unnerving silence.  Even your own footsteps and breath seem to echo a little too much between the trunks.”_

_(Hams)_ — The stillness isn't predator quiet. It’s _wrong_ quiet. Your hand gets this itch to want to grab the hilt of your weapon, its instinctive... 

_(Johann)_ — You’ve walked through ancient groves, you've sailed to far away hidden forests.. This isn’t one. This forest feels.. off..

### 🧠 **Perception/Survival Checks (Creeping Presence):**

| DC                 | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PER **DC 10-15**   | Spot a humanoid shape briefly at a distance — just between the trees, passing between two trunks— but it’s gone when you look again. Seemed to be moving **west or south** (**Secret DM Note: This is infected Calen moving towards the town.)** |
| SUR **DC 15 - 18** | Smell something wrong. Not decay. Not rot. Something **wet and warm** beneath the bark. Like breath held too long in a sealed room.                                                                                                              |

Let it hit one or two players, not the whole party — and only once. No second sightings. Just discomfort.

### 🧩 Optional Clues while traveling. 

- **Nature/Arcana DC 17**

	- White mold growing on the _sunny_ side of a tree (not normal).


- **DC 15 Survival/Nature**

	_“One of you catches a faint disturbance in the underbrush — a thin branch twisted into a spiral and tucked carefully into the crook of a tree’s root system.”_  
	
	_“It’s not random. Someone placed it deliberately — and recently. Moss hasn’t started to grow back where the ground was disturbed.”_
	
	"*You remember Nola mentioning that Erel used to leave signals when he ventured deep into the woods — a habit learned from his uncle Calen, she said. Quiet marks, subtle and natural, just in case his family ever came looking*"

	**Discovery: A small flat stone with a charcoal mark scratched into it (a direction or a time). If they pick up the flat stone, the backside is slick with slime**

---

# **Brindlewild – Arrival**

---

## 🧱 **Before the Wall (First Glimpse from the Trail)**

> _The trees thin ahead, allowing you to glimpse open sky for the first time in a while. The setting sun casts a warm light over the clearing beyond — a grassy incline spread before you like an old, forgotten pasture._
> 
> _Where the forest ends, a modest field begins. Fallow rows stretch outward, choked with weeds. Dead vines coil in shallow furrows, and small wooden pins stand empty — meant for animals that clearly haven’t grazed in days._
> 
> _A worn footpath splits the field, leading to a break in a low stone wall that rings the hill. There’s no gate, no signage, no welcome — just stones, lichen-spotted and half-sunken in the earth. The footpath winds through and ascends the hill ahead._
> 
> _From here, you spot a crooked silo and a slanted barn, its thatched roof half-covered in moss. One or two homes lie beyond, barely visible beyond the curve of the path. The whole place feels still. Watched. Like a breath held too long._

### **Skill Check Opportunities (Before Wall):**

- **Group Perception/Investigation DC 10–15**:
    
    - _You notice nothing here’s been tended for a while. No tools in the fields. No footprints. No birdsong. Just wind._
        
    - _A strange yellowish haze tints the world — not thick, but enough to make everything not in your immediate vicinity feel... old._
        
- **DC 5 Survival/Investigation**:
    
    - _You spot a scrap of leather, recently tanned, caught on a fence post. Fresh. Not placed. Dropped in a hurry._
        

---

## 🌫️ **Beyond the Threshold (Crossing into Brindlewild)**

> _As you step past the broken stones, the air changes. Not colder. Not warmer. Just... heavier. Like humidity that’s clung to your skin without you noticing._
> 
> _Then it hits: the smell. Not rot. Not death. Something almost floral. Sweet. Spoiled. Like wilted petals left in the sun too long — thick, wet, and warm. It coats your tongue, clings to your teeth._
> 
> _(If they succeeded on the earlier campsite check:)_  
> _You’ve smelled this before. Back at camp. Barely a hint of it on the wind. Now? It’s all around you. And it’s stronger._
> (_Arcturus)_ — The floral rot on the air is unnerving.. for a brief moment you feel like you are back to where you were once dumped and left for dead..

> _Boots crunch on brittle grass as the hill crests. What catches your eye is that moss you saw covering the structures from before the hill... as you approach you notice something off about it. 
> 
> _Its not moss. Its not web either, atleast nothing you've ever seen before. Its pale, veined, mucous-like — coils over rooftops and walls. Bulbous growths swell in the eaves. Thin, wet looking, membranes stretch between the structures, some clinging to the ground, others webbed above your head like the strands of a grotesque vine. It reaches for everything around it, and connects in what could only be described as vein like tubes_
> 
> Dust puffs softly from cracks in wooden frames. The barn and the nearby house are connected — not by planks or fences, but by strange, swamp like, sparse tissue growth._

---

### 💀 **Body Horror – The Barn Wall**

> When you start to pass the barn, your eye catches the view of a partial humanoid like figure. 
> 
> _A woman’s face emerges from the siding beside the barn door. Or... what’s left of one. Her mouth hangs open, frozen mid-gasp. The whites of her eyes are yellowed and bloodshot, her sockets sunken. From the back of her head, gill-like fungal growths bloom like a grotesque crown._
> 
> _One arm has been pulled into the frame — not pinned, not broken, but _absorbed_. Her fingers splay into the wood, the tips missing their nails and transformed into a tangled mass of sinew and organic growth, worming through the cracks in the door and frame.  Her other arm melds into the wall a the elbow. 
> 
> _The rest of her lower body is all but missing, its stretched. Reabsorbed. A suggestion of shape of her lower half remains — like a wax figure that was thrown at incredible speeds at the wall and splattered, but thats not what happened here. There is no gore, there is no blood, just undulating webbing spreading out across the wall, ceiling and ground.
> 
  As you examine the remains of this person, her eye snaps to the side and looks directly at you. Intently focused and following your movements._

### **Medicine/Investigation Check DC 14+**

- _You catch the detail: her pupil contracts and expands, again and again. A rhythmic pulsing, too precise to be natural._
*if Player decides to interact or get VERY close to the woman, give a infection token*

---

### 🕷️ **Tactile DM Note (If players touch the membrane or mold):**

> _The surface is slick and warm. It gives under your touch — not like moss, but like skin with too much water under it. Then it pulses. Just once. As if... it felt you back._

---

### 🩸 **Crawling Remains (On path toward Brindlewild’s east side):**

> _Something stirs in the tall grass ahead. A set of legs connected to a pelvis — no torso, no blood, just two legs lying side by side connected by what seems to be a melted pelvis, fused into a fan of pulsing color where they meet the ground and spreads out like feelers cutting through the grass._
> 
> _They move gently, slowly, uselessly. As if trying to crawl forward, in attempt to move down the path carved into the hill to the rest of the modest gathering of homes — but they are fused too tightly to the web of membrane beneath to move more than a few inches and then come to rest exactly where it was before._

_(**DC 13 Perception):_**  
> _The legs are humanoid. Smaller than adult, larger than dwarf. The clothing it wears gives indication of carefree playful youth, childlike. 

---

### 🏠 **Subtle Foreshadowing – Calen’s House**

> _Farther away, on the other side of the hill, the landscape slopes down, mostly hidden behind the brush, sparse tree and haze, one house seems less overtaken than the others. Its roof has gaps, its siding is bowed, but the growth hasn’t fully consumed it._

---

## 🏚️ **Calen’s House – The Final Home**

> _You descend the  rise into what feels like the forgotten edge of Brindlewild — a house perched at the tail end of the settlement, removed just enough to delay its complete overtaking._

### 🧠 Player Perception/Investigation Opportunities

- **Perception DC 12**:  
    _You spot faint boot tracks in the muck — one adult-sized, another smaller. The adult tracks leave the house. The smaller ones end at the front door._
    
- **Investigation DC 13**:  
    _The fungal growth on this house is thinner. Not absent — just not advanced. Unlike the other buildings, the mold here hasn't fully sealed the structure shut._
    

---

### 🪞 **The Exterior**

The house stands hunched beneath a curtain of hanging moss and sinewed membrane. The door is cracked open two inches. Inside, dim golden light leaks from a single fungal pustule, casting weird shadows.

> Through the gap in the door, you catch a glimpse of something lying on the warped floorboards: **a recurved elven bow** resting awkwardly on the ground, strands of puffball fungus exhaling small clouds with every breeze.

#### 🎲 Player Options:

- **Attempt to enter through the door:**
    
    - **Small-sized character**: Can squeeze in (no check). Gains **1 Infection Token** for contact exposure.
        
    - **Medium+ character**: DC 14 Strength (Athletics) to shoulder through the membrane.
        
        - On success, gain **2 Infection Tokens** from spore exposure.
            
        - On fail, stuck — advantage on next attempt but risk alerting creatures outside.
            
- **Attempt the window:**
    
    - DC 12 Acrobatics or Dexterity check to climb through safely.
        
        - Success: You slip in and may unlock the front door from inside.
            
        - You gain **1 Infection Token**.
            

#### 🧪 Optional: Arcana/Nature DC 15

_Reveals that the membrane reacts to motion and pressure — a network, not individual growths. It might have "nerves."_

---

### 🕯️ **Interior – The Creep of Growth**

> The inside of the house is warped by fungal overgrowth. What once might have been a modest kitchen, living space, and sleeping quarters are now strangled with pulsing mycelium. Furniture is fused to the walls or half-reabsorbed into them. Hallways twist unnaturally, narrowed to tunnels carved by time and decay.

Let the players explore:

#### 📦 **Exploration Opportunities:**

- **DC 12 Perception (Kitchen area)**:  
    Find **Calen’s hunting knife**, half-fused into a cutting block. It's a +1 dagger with a leather-wrapped hilt that resists fungal corrosion.
    
- **DC 14 Investigation (Living space)**:  
    Uncover a **leatherbound field journal** with pressed truffle spore prints, elven shorthand notes, and **a sketch of Brindlewild with coded trail markers**. (Provides advantage on future navigation checks through High Forest or similar terrain.)
    
- **DC 15 Arcana (Bedroom)**:  
    Identify a **spore-slicked charm** hanging from the ceiling: A minor magical token that can cast _Detect Poison and Disease_ once per long rest. Touching it gives 1 Infection Token.

### 🎯 **Erel’s Bow and the Horror Above**

As the players move to recover the **bow** on the floor:

> _The house suddenly feels too quiet. The air is thick and wet. Then comes the sound — slow, ragged **breathing**. Not coming from behind or around you... but **above**._

> _You look up. And see him._

> _**Erel** is affixed to the ceiling like a grotesque tapestry — his back faces you, his chest pressed against the ceiling, his skin and muscle has been exposed and where spine should mee the ribs is splayed open, ribs stretched and bent open, vines and mold gently pulsing around organs that are still functioning — barely.  His jaw slack, held open by fibrous growths weaved between his teeth, holding his tongue down. The wheezing breath rasps from between ruined vocal cords and wet lungs worked like bellows by fungal veins. His head is turned in an impossible direction to be facing you and his eyes... are open. And watching._

### 🧠 Player Reactions

- **Medicine DC 14**:  
    _He’s not alive — but he’s not fully dead. His heart beats. His lungs inflate. But none of it is _his_. The fungus is performing him like a puppet._
    
- **Insight DC 12**:  
    _There’s a faint twitch — recognition. Maybe he knows you’re here. His pulsing pupils track any foreign movements in the room, but the eyelids never bink_ 
    
- **Optional Horror Sanity Rule**:  
    Characters who fail a DC 13 Wisdom save gain 1 point of Short-Term Madness (Frightened for 1 round, elect to take disadvantage on their initiative, with infection die bolstering).

### 🎒 **Calen's Satchel**

Near the exit lies a satchel — torn open, contents scattered as though dropped in haste.

Inside:

- **A rust color-stained waterskin** (contaminated)
    
- **A weatherproof scroll tube** (contains a map with marked safe trails)
    
- **A bundle of crushed mushrooms** – Identifiable with DC 15 Nature as _not native_ to the region (The infection is not just spreading, it’s _foreign_).
    
- **A sealed pouch of dry medicinal herbs** — still usable for making an antidote if the party pursues that path.

# 🐺 **Encounter Trigger – Fungal Wolves**

Five minutes after the players begin exploration:

> _A distant howl. Wet. Distorted. Followed by another. Then closer._

A pack of **fungal-infected wolves** stalks the house. Choose one:

- **Option A – Encounter Outside**:  
    Wolves surround the house. Players must defend or escape.
    
- **Option B – Encounter Inside**:  
    Wolves force entry. Use tight spaces, windows, and choke points for tactical depth.
    

🧱 Stats: Use **Wolf stat block**, but add:

- Resistance to piercing/slashing from nonmagical weapons.
    
- On bite: DC 11 Con save or gain 1 Infection Token.

### 🧟 **Corrupted Hill Giant**

As the players leave:

> _A loud crack. A nearby house, overtaken by massive fungal pustules, shifts. A slow tearing sound. Wood groans. Then — it moves._

Emerging from the fungal husk is a **Corrupted Hill Giant**, half-fused with the building it grew inside.

- **Weakness Mechanic**: Exposed fungal nodes on its chest/back can be targeted for double damage (DC 15 Perception or Investigation to spot).
    
- **Goal**: Motivate **flight over fight**, but reward creative tactics or risk-taking.
    
- **Sound cue**: Guttural moan, and as it lumbers after them, it breaks parts of nearby buildings unintentionally, creating terrain hazards.

LOOT:  
    Find **Calen’s hunting knife**, half-fused into the giant's achilies tendon, requiring a DC 10 strength check to pull it out.  It's an elven curved bladed dagger, silvered with beautiful etching on it, with leather-wrapped hilt that has small darkend pocks where mold has rotted its aesthetics.

### 🏃 **Escape Options**

- **Run back through the forest** — triggering another infection hazard zone.
    
- **Try to hide** — DC 18 Stealth group check.
    
- **Use the house as a trap** — collapse it on the giant (DC 17 Int or Enginuity check + supporting skill).
    

If they do flee — read the following:

> _Behind you, the sounds of ruin echo — the fungal giant roaring as it tears through what’s left of Brindlewild. It doesn’t seem interested in you anymore. 

---
Returning to Zelbross, if they choose to fight they will likely need to take a short rest or they can run full speed and make it back. When the players break the tree line, its fully night time, but the sky glows over Zelbross. When the players arrive at Zelbross they will find corrupted Drow and forrest creatures attacking. Half of the merchants and people who live in Zelbross are taken by the fungus and are attacking eachother, fires in various places, the same kind of haze they saw at Brindlewild creeping in.  

- Possible ending option 1 (if the players try to enter town): The players are grabbed by Tess and told the town is lost and that they need to get to her carriage on the other side of town. She is making good on her promise and just wants to get out alive with what she has. 

- Possible Ending Option 2 (if the players try to avoid Zelbross): Tess rides up with her carriage and tells the players to get on, with Nola and Mira in the back. Nola is conscious, while Mira is mortally wounded and unconscious. 


**END SESSION.**
