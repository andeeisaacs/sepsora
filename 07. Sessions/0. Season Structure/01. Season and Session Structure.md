# 🎯 **Key Pacing Notes:**

- No session feels like a "filler" — every session **builds forward**.
    
- Every session ends with a hook pulling them into the next.
    
- Major turning points happen roughly every **5 sessions**.
    
- Final session leaves _questions unanswered_ and _threads dangling_ — like a true _season_ finale, not an end.
