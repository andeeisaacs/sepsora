# **Sepsora – Act II Outline


---

## Possible ideas

### 🎬 Opening Beat:

- Players leave the devastated frontier towns, journeying toward Waterdeep.
    
- The world feels _off_ — sick forests, weeping sap, hushed skies.

- Environmental hazards: spore clouds, sickened animals, warped trees.
    

**DCs:**

- Survival DC 12: Avoid heavily spored paths (otherwise light Constitution save DC 10 vs light spore exposure).
    
- Perception DC 14: Spot faint fungal webbing across trees (hidden dangers).
    

**Fork 1:**

- Success: Travel mostly safe.
    
- Failure: Minor spore sickness (temporary Constitution debuff).
    


- Discover half-sunken merchant caravan, fungal tendrils pulling it underground.
    
- One infected survivor muttering riddles ("the roots sing... the stars burn green...").
    

**Combat:**

- 2x Infected Wolves (use **Wolf stat block** with minor fungal mutation:
    
    - **Mushroom Burst** on death: creatures within 5 ft. make Dex Save DC 13 or take 1d6 poison damage.)
        

**Loot:**

- 15 gp in loose merchant purses
    
- 1x "Cleansing Salve" (Potion of Lesser Restoration — rare and precious)
    

- Forest visibly "breathing" in places — trees pulsing with internal fungal threads.

- Players discover the ruins of an ancient Druidic shrine _overgrown with vibrant but twisted flowers._

### Druid Circle ideas

- Players reach a clearing: a perfectly circular grove of ancient trees.
    
- The **Circle of Advent awaits.
    
### 🧩 Scene 1: Meeting the Druid Circle

- Druids are calm, welcoming, speaking of “the new season” with serene smiles. Mushroom coming out of skull. Wearing hoods, find a way to hide the fact they are willing.
    

**DCs:**

- Insight DC 13: Druids clearly under influence, but not fully infected — _willing participants._
    
- Religion DC 14: Old rites here are perverted versions of natural balance ceremonies.
    

**Fork 1:**

- Diplomacy:
    
    - Successful Persuasion DC 15: Druids reluctantly allow them to leave unharmed.
        
    - Failure/Hostility: They are **ceremonially imprisoned** to "cleanse" them.

### 🧩 Scene 2: Druidic Cleansing Ritual

- If captured:
    
    - Escape skill challenge (Athletics DC 14, Stealth DC 13, Arcana DC 15 to disrupt fungal growths).
        

---

### 🧩 Scene 3: Escape or Cleansing

- Combat option:
    
    - Fight 2x Druid Cultists (stats: Druid with limited spell use) + 2x Myconid Sprouts (CR ¼ each).
        

---

### Waterdeep Ideas

- Approaching Waterdeep’s massive gates, players find chaotic refugee camps.
### 🧩 Scene 1: Refugee Desperation

- Camps fighting over resources.
    
- Players can help, bribe, or sneak through chaos.
    

**DCs:**

- Deception/Persuasion DC 14: Talk way into Waterdeep.
    
- Stealth DC 15: Sneak through chaotic guard patrols.
    

**Fork 1:**

- Success: Enter Waterdeep unmarked.
    
- Failure: Flagged as "possible fungal carriers" — monitored by guards.
    

---

### 🧩 Scene 2: Waterdeep Inside

- Heavy militarization.
    
- Suspicion toward outsiders, especially elves, tieflings, druids and especially drow.
    

**Optional Combat:**

- 1x Patrol Squad (use **Guards** stat block): only if players escalate tensions.
    

---

### 🧩 Scene 3: First Signs Inside

- Sickly green growth inside cracks of outer city stonework.

---

### 🎭 Cliffhanger:

- In back alleys at night, players spot **robed figures feeding infected spores** into sewer grates.

### Session 2: _Shadows in the Cells_ (unchanged with added Drow tension)
