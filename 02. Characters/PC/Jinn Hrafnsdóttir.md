In Session 2, during the fight in Brindlewild with the Corrupt Hill Giant and the various other corrupt woodland, Jinn despite being a hardened fighter expressed doubts on their survivability thus started to flee the combat- but upon witnessing the [[🧠 Corrupted Hill Giant — "The Shambler of Brindlewild"]] falling upon [[Hams Stoutmouse]] she heroically lassoed the Hill Giant, pulling it off of Hams and also dismembering the bound leg from the torso. 

# Background
 A fierce warrior wdaof ***Uthgardt Raven Tribe*** blood, Jinn lost her parents to battle at age three. To spare her the same fate, her grandmother took her south to the Sword Coast when she was eleven. Raised on tribal traditions and hardened by loss, Jinn trained by her tribe and grandmother relentlessly in the ways of the polearm and blade.
 
  As a teen, she fell in with outcasts and grave-scavengers, raiding old ruins and monster lairs for coin. until a failed nobles caravan raid landed her in prison. There, she fought her way to freedom through brutal gladiatorial combat. Her skill caught the eye of the Lord’s Alliance, who conscripted her to fight monsters, bandits, and in border skirmishes.
  
   Though a deadly asset in war, her disdain for authority and the arcane led to a dishonorable discharge. Now, Jinn walks a mercenary’s path, taking odd jobs and dangerous work to provide for herself and her aging grandmother, battle-scarred, proud, and free.
