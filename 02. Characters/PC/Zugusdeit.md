## Backstory (Spoken):
"I grew up without any parents or family in lower Baldurs Gate, I stole when I had to and fought for everything I had. 

As I grew older, a kind traveler took me in their care and showed me the beauty of the world waiting to be experienced. They taught me many things of the arcane, domestic, and martial disciplines.

Even with how pivotal and important they were in my life, I'm unable to describe them with any meaningful detail. Aside from knowledge, they imparted on me a love and enthusiasm for travel, adventure, and new experiences."

## Appearance: 
Tall female Aasimar, caucasian complexion with very faint powder blue hue. The half Dragonborn side shows as patches of brilliant blue scales in various places. Tall, strong, amazonian (Wonder Woman-esque), warrior build.

	I've been close to death several times: cold, hunger, beasts in the wild, and a group of bandits. It's been difficult, but I'm still here.
