## Backstory:

Hams comes from a tight-nit family who owns a modest but sucessfull farm outside of town. His brothers are bards and artists who think that they have a strong connection with the forest and animals, however, they're full of shit. Hams having a penchant for languages knows five of them and is able to have rudimentary conversations with animals. Sneaking away to hide up in the trees overlooking the roads. Feeling protective over people of all races and animals, he would frequently disable traps and snares set out by robbers and bandits. It wasn't until he observed rangers in the same forests he was hiding in that he realized that he could step out of the background. He started out as a guide guaranteeing safe travels, great eats, and even better stories. This got his name out across the different taverns locally and abroad. Now Hams was receiving offers to join much more experienced adventurers on increasingly dangerous expeditions. Hams time and time again has proven to be an amazing asset to the team with his quick thinking, agility, marksmanship, and overall morale boost.

## Appearance: 
A young adult halfling, 50 years old. He has tanned skinned and medium brown shaggy hair. Hams is tall for a halfling -- although no one believes him. Growing up on a farm, he is obsessed with having fine things, even if it doesn't quite fit him. For instance, he carries around a cognac-color satchel with straps that are just a tad too long for him. Additionally, he wears a elegantly woven ivory colored linen shirt that is much too baggy and long.

He rolls up his sleeves and tucks in his shirt as best he can, always claiming that he just needs to get this to a tailor the next time he's in town (he never ever attempts to find one.) He wears a brown vest and pants with secret pockets that help hide his little vials of potions. Along with worn leather boots that have quite a bit of a heel (that he stores his gold pieces in.) He wears a dark green cloak that drags on the floor... sometimes. Anyways, the tailor will get to it.

Who trained you?
	Various Rangers, raccoons, and observing various soldiers training while I was tucked away in the trees.

	A bow recovered from a dead body lying in the forest. I asked the dead guy if I could have it. He didn't say no.
