Name: Johann Silverleg
Pronouns: He/Him
Species: Wood Elf
Gender: Male
Class: Druid
Wields: [[Coral-Fused Buckler of the Tidewatch]]

# Background
As a lad from a remote wood elf village, Johann was found to be predisposed to the magical arts and sent to train as an apprentice to the Silvenar wood elf wizard and sage Gilgondrion. While magically adept, Johann did not particularly take to the cloistered life of an elder wizard's apprentice.

 After several years and some magical training, he left Gilgondrion's tutelage (to the disappointment of Johann's parents) to discover himself and lived among the tribes of wilder people along the coast. There, he focused his magical talents on learning to channel the magics of land and sea to live in harmony with nature. From time to time, he would come in contact with Zenitan pirates and smugglers who would occasionally trade some of their plunder for provisons and a safe harbor with the wilderpeople. Time past and his gap year became a gap decade - and eventually wanderlust would capture his spirit again. Johann grew fascinated with the tales and stories spun by the Zenitan pirates. He grew curious about life in these so-called "cities" - and the wider world in general. Change and growth are two constants of Nature, so when Johann booked passage with some smugglers to visit the city folk - the druids of his circle wished him good fortune on his travels. 
 
## Appearance: 
 6' tall male woodelf, strawberry blonde hair, dressed like a pirate (tricorne hat, scimitar, leather armor) because that's what he belives city folk dress like. 
 
 His Wild companion (druid familliar) is a Parrot that often sits on his shoulder; use Raven stat block as they're both corvids with mimicry. Calls himself Johann "Silverleg" because he thinks that's what city folk (pirates) do. 

# Character questions and answers
 Have you ever tried to grow something? 
	 I'm a wood elf. And a druid. 
 Did it survive? 
	I'm a *wood elf.* And a *druid.*
  Who taught you to read, or did you teach yourself? 
	  While my parents taught me the basics, I was briefly an apprentice under the Silvanar Wizard Gilgondrion in the woodelf realm. Much of my literate knowledge of Arcana and History was gained from him. 
  You witness a domestic dispute in a public square. What do you do? 
	  I intervene with a simple charm cantrip I learned from Gilgondrion. I convince both parties that they should break up, permanently. Then I leave. When the charm wears off, they'll either blame my sorcery for their argument and reunite or decide they are better off apart. Either way, the dispute has been resolved. 
  How did you learn combat?
	   I learned a bit under the tutelage of Gilgondrion but, most of my knowledge I acquired from the druidic circles of the coastal wilder tribes. 
  Why did you learn it?
	It was required, both when training as an apprentice under Gilgondrion and as a Warden druid of the wilder people. 
Who trained you?
	The Druidic Circles of the wilder people tribes. 
What was your first real weapon?
	My mind, Gilgondrion taught me to harness latent psychic magics to crush any weak minded ruffian.
If you could learn one new form of combat, what would it be and why? 
	The marksmen of my wood elf people are famous the world over. Though it is not an artform I currently practice, It does posses a certain ... elegance. 
You built a tower of pebbles or a cairn. You witness someone kick it over. How do you feel? 
	Irritated. 
What do you do? 
	Use Mind Sliver to give them a migraine.
Have you ever met a monster that didn’t feel like a monster to you? 
	Most city folk treat the living beings of the sea as so called "monsters," whether it be a shark, octopus or the more learned Kuo-Toa, Sahuagin, or Naga peoples. Such is the ignorance of the city-folk when it comes to "monsters" and anything else they don't undeterstand. 
How do you feel about the undead (Skeletons, Zombies, Ghouls)?
	An abomination against nature. 
What if they are fully conscious?
	A greater abomination against nature.
What about vampires who are fully aware? 
	An. Abomination. Against. Nature. 
How do you keep your money safe while traveling? 
	The Zenitan pirates have a phrase - the "prison wallet." Most useful. 
If you found a version of yourself in a mirror that blinked when you didn’t, what would you do? 
	Lick the mirror ;)
What’s your backup plan if this whole ‘adventuring’ thing doesn’t work out? 
	Go back to the wilderpeople settlements by the sea.
You just realized you accidentally stole something from a merchant, and they are unaware yet. Now what? 
	I "accidentally" walk out the door and "accidentally" go about my day as normal because the notion of owning things or land is city folk nonsense that I only abide out of politeness for local custom. If they are none the wiser, then I am not being impolite.
