## Backstory

After the death of their parents, Arcturus Elderflower ascended to the throne of their island kingdom. Trained in social grace, they ruled with compassion for exactly 6 months wherein the morning at exactly 3 o’clock sharp they were awakened to 2 figures that dragged them out to 1 room where their aunt was waiting. 

This coupe was the end of the road for Arcturus and they knew it. The Elderflower family had notably identifiable physical features and in order to stop the public from finding Arcturus’ corpse and creating a martyr’s effigy, their face was burned and they were dumped them in the mangroves to die alone and in obscurity. 

In the final light of Arcturus’s last day, behind the sound of birds, water and scent of burned meat, the sound of uneven footsteps approached. An old god; The Crooken One breathed an offer of life, purpose and most of all, promises of a vengeful homecoming. 

On the third breathe of first day they took the name Deepwater and took the Pact of Chains. Despite their innate ability, Deepwater never healed their scars and would never use their Heavenly Wings again.

### Character response questions
Do you want a romantic partner?
    
    • Don’t be ridiculous, I do not want a romantic partner. What am I?! A priest!? It is commonplace in my land to have 2 fulltime partners. I would be ridiculed to ever be seen with just one! People would talk for weeks about how I mistreat my other partner leaving them at home alone! It would be outrageous.
    
    
Tell the story behind one scar you carry, is it visible to others and is it large, small, or strange
    
    • This facial scar was given to me by the lackeys of my traitorous aunt. I kinda like, it don’t you? (Noted: starts casting Necrotic Shroud)
    
 What’s something a stranger could do that would annoy you all day?
    
    • If one more person touches my facial scars without permission I am going to get a custom made cloak , it will have a custom magical enchantment that when someone tries to touch my face will glow bright red and start a fake “defense system activated” countdown. That’s what I’m going to do. 
    
    31.Favorite vice: pipeweed, liquor, kissing, knife tricks, bathing, lusty warthogs, etc. Explain. • Kissing… Oh explain? I approach love as a buffet and not sit-down restaurant.
    
Do you wish to know how you die?
    
    • Why would I fear death? I will die ruling in my home kingdom, next to my many partners, in a throne room decorated by my bronzed-living treasonous usurpers.  
    
Have you ever accepted a curse willingly?
    
    • The Crooken One is not what you would call a magnanimous god, I was able to live but can no longer use my Heavenly Wings.
    
Have you ever been tattooed, branded, or magically marked without your consent?
    
    • Yes....
    
You’re offered a powerful artifact — but you must sacrifice your memories of one person to use it. Do you?,
    
    • No. In the deepest nights all I have are my thoughts and memories, they align me as a north star.
    
 Do you have a nemesis?
    
    • They wear cheap perfume. With all the power and status of my kingdom, the best education money can buy: they wear scent that can only be kindly described as cake that had been ruminating in a chamber pot with oud after being tossed into a tar pit 6 months.

Coiling Grasp Tattoo
Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything
_Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)_

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo has long intertwining designs.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

**Grasping Tendrils.** While the tattoo is on your skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to extrude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo on a different creature.
