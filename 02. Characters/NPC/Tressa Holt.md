# Tressa Holt #npc

## At a Glance
- **Tagline:** Veteran caravan leader turned survivor-ally.
- **Wants:** Rest, recover, then help find Nola (and/or contain the fallout).
- **Leverage:** Practical resources (cart, contacts), credibility, survival instincts.
- **If confronted, she will:** Tell it straight, push urgency, avoid heroics she can’t win.
- **Voice:** Tired competence; “I’ve seen worse, but not this fast.”

## Canon Notes
- Arrived injured after Moss & Hide went critical.
- Helped the party escape Zelbross toward Secomber.
- **Current:** In Secomber, exhausted, laying low (tavern), planning to rest then seek Nola if she can.
