### **Traits**

**Eternal Form.** Kronos is immune to aging effects and cannot be affected by time-altering magic unless he chooses to be.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Kronos fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Chrono-Shift (Recharge 5–6).** When hit by an attack or forced to make a saving throw, Kronos can shift briefly out of phase with time. He takes no damage and suffers no effect, reappearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet.

**Warp Reality.** Time bends around Kronos. When a creature he can see starts its turn within 30 feet of him, he can choose to force it to roll a d6. On a 1–2, the creature can’t take a bonus action; on a 3–4, it can't take reactions; on a 5–6, its movement speed is halved until the end of its turn.

---

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** Kronos makes three Scythe of Ages attacks.

**Scythe of Ages.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 31 (4d10 + 9) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) necrotic damage. The target must succeed a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or age 1d10 years. This magical aging cannot be reversed except by *Greater Restoration* or *Wish*.

**Reap the Present (Recharge 6).** Kronos marks a point in space he can see within 100 feet. All creatures in a 30-foot radius must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are either stunned, slowed (as *slow* spell), or take 45 (10d8) psychic damage—Kronos chooses for each. On a success, they take half damage.

**Time Rend (1/Day).** Kronos tears a hole in time. Creatures in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or vanish from existence for 1d4 rounds (as *time stop*, but they are removed from combat). They reappear in the same space or the nearest unoccupied one if it's taken.

---

### **Legendary Actions** (3/round)

Kronos can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn.

- **Warp Step.** Kronos teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space.
- **Temporal Backlash.** A creature Kronos can see that hit him with an attack must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be thrown 6 seconds into the past. Until the start of Kronos’s next turn, the creature repeats its last action (GM's discretion).
- **Echo of Ages (Costs 2 Actions).** Kronos casts *hold monster* or *banishment* (DC 22), requiring no components.

---

### **Lair Actions** (If in the Temporal Nexus)

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Kronos can cause one of the following effects in his lair:

- **Chrono Surge.** All creatures must reroll initiative. The new order lasts for 1 minute.
- **Reverse Flow.** All ongoing spells with durations count backward instead of forward until the end of the round.
- **Stasis Pulse.** All reactions are disabled until the end of the next round.

---

### **Description**
Kronos, known as *The Crooked One*, is not a deity of time—but time itself made flesh, warped and bound by mortal perception. His motivations are unknowable, though he is neither cruel nor kind. He appears as a towering, partially blurred titan whose scythe gleams with moments yet to come.
