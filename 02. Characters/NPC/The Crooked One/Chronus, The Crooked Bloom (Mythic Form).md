### **Traits**

**Mythic Resilience (1/Day).** When Chronus is reduced to 0 HP, he does not die. Instead, he explodes in a cloud of spore-laced temporal matter and regains 400 hit points, entering his **Second Phase** (see below).

**Time-Rotted Bloom.** Chronus exists in overlapping timelines. Any creature that ends its turn within 20 ft. must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become **Unmoored**. While unmoored, the creature is unable to take reactions, takes an extra 10 (3d6) psychic damage per spell cast, and suffers disadvantage on Initiative rolls until the end of its next long rest.

**Spore Reactor.** If Chronus takes fire damage equal to or greater than 50 in a single turn, his spore sacs rupture violently. At the end of that turn, all creatures within 60 feet must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 45 (10d8) poison damage and become **Blinded** until the end of their next turn. On success, they take half damage and aren’t blinded.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If Chronus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

---

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** Chronus makes four attacks with *Scythe of Wilted Time* or *Mycelial Lance*.

**Scythe of Wilted Time.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 25 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 36 (6d6 + 15) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) necrotic damage. Target must succeed a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be **Aged** (see below).

> **Aged:** Aged creatures have their speed halved, lose resistance to necrotic, and cannot benefit from extra attack features. This effect lasts until removed by *Greater Restoration* or *Wish*.

**Mycelial Lance.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 30 (6d10 + 3) poison damage and the target is **Infested**. At the start of their next turn, they take 22 (4d10) necrotic damage as spores burst from their skin.

**Spores of the End (Recharge 5–6).** Chronus releases fungal spores suspended in fractured time. All creatures within 100 ft. must succeed a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or:
- Become **Paralyzed** for 1 minute.  
- See **illusory duplicates of themselves** moving out of sync, granting attackers advantage.  
- Or suffer **Madness (Short-Term)** as per DMG rules.

Chronus chooses for each creature which effect applies.

---

### **Legendary Actions** *(3/round)*

Chronus can take 3 legendary actions, only one at a time, at the end of another creature’s turn.

- **Fungal Warp.** Teleport up to 90 feet to an unoccupied space in dim light or fungal terrain.
- **Rot Echo.** Force a creature within 30 feet to reroll its last successful saving throw.
- **Scour the Past (Costs 2 Actions).** Remove the most recent effect of *any* healing, buff, or magical aid granted within the last round from a creature within 60 feet.

---

### **Phase Two: Rot Unbound**

When Chronus enters this phase (via **Mythic Resilience**), read or paraphrase:

> _“The shell cracks—and from within erupts a chorus of spore-choked screams. What remains is not a titan, but a memory unglued—writhing with tendrils and fossilized regret.”_

**Changes in Phase Two:**
- Speed reduced to 20 ft., but he gains **Fly 90 ft. (hover)**  
- **Each of his attacks deal an extra 10 (3d6) psychic damage**  
- **All saves against his effects have disadvantage**
- Gains **Lairwide Teleportation**: once per round, he may appear anywhere in his lair
- His lair actions now occur **every round on initiative 20**, not just once per round

---

### **Lair Actions** *(Phase Two only)*

- **Temporal Spoilage.** Choose a creature. Its next turn occurs at the end of the round instead of its normal initiative.
- **Mycelial Hivemind.** Chronus gains resistance to the next 3 sources of fire damage this round (this does not override his vulnerability, but stacks to counteract it).
- **Rotting Awakening.** One dead creature in the lair reanimates as a *Mycotic Husk* (CR 10 undead, use Fungal Abomination or Flesh Golem stats as base).

---

### **Description**

A festering titan of time and mold, **Chronus** now serves no will but that of Sepsora—the Bloom That Watches. His scythe is no longer metal, but a sharpened hyphae rib, and his face is half-erased by blooming fruiting bodies. He **remembers futures that never happened** and **reaps the regrets of worlds** that could have been.

>_"I am not late. You are simply... premature."_  
> – **Chronus, The Crooked Bloom**
