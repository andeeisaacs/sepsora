## Canon Notes
- His **satchel + journal** were found (survival supplies, observations, escalating fear).
- His home became overgrown/assimilated; during the hill giant fight, the building collapse **crushed what remained of Erel**.
- His journal ties together: strange fauna behavior, calm day-walking Drow in Lolth armor, and hidden Underdark routes.
