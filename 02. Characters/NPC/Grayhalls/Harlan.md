## Canon Notes
- First major host—allowed the growth to spread rapidly through Zelbross.
- Found partially fused into Moss & Hide; spoke garbled pleas; then animated as a fungal defense mechanism.
- Party destroyed his mutated form and the Membrane Node.
- Post-destruction: Sepsora repurposes remains as infrastructure (DM lever).
