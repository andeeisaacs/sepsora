# Governor Richard Der'ier #npc

## At a Glance
- **Tagline:** Secomber’s authority figure — panic dressed as policy.
- **Wants:** Control, plausible deniability, and survival.
- **Leverage:** Guards, legal power, narratives (“I did what I had to”), and scapegoats.
- **If confronted, he will:** Justify arrests/labor as necessity; bargain if cornered; betray if safe.

## Canon Notes
- Ordered mass arrests of Drow and druids.
- Authorized forced labor tunnel expansion.
- Created conditions that led to the prison disaster.
- Set up as the moral/political pivot point of Session 8.

## DM Knobs (pick the version you like)
- **Coward:** did it for self-preservation.
- **Believer:** convinced Sepsora was “containable” or “useful.”
- **Complicit:** knowingly fed bodies to the machine.
