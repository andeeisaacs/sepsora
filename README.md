# Sepsora Vault

This vault captures the worldbuilding, campaign prep, and session notes for Sepsora. It is organized for quick navigation in Obsidian so you can jump between characters, locations, items, and session logs with consistent tagging and link patterns.

## Structure
- `01. DM Screen`: Session-ready reference notes and rules quick hits for running games at the table.
- `02. Characters`: Player characters, major NPCs, and factions; consider keeping one note per notable entity.
- `03. Locations`: Regions, settlements, and dungeons, with nested notes for points of interest.
- `04. Items`: Magic items, equipment, and artifacts tied to characters or locations.
- `05. Spells & Abilities`: Custom spells, class abilities, or homebrew mechanics.
- `06. Lore`: World history, myths, cultures, and cosmology.
- `07. Sessions`: Session logs, recaps, and prep checklists ordered by date or session number.
- `08. Monsters`: Bestiary-style entries for monsters, hazards, and stat references.
- `20. Assets`: Images, maps, handouts, and other non-text resources.
- `90._Templates`: Note templates for new entries; clone and fill to keep formatting consistent.

## Tagging
- Favor pure tags (e.g., `#character`, `#location`, `#session`, `#item`, `#lore`, `#monster`, `#quest`) to connect related notes without extra link clutter.
- Add specific subtype tags when helpful, such as `#faction`, `#settlement`, `#dungeon`, or `#artifact`.
- Place tags near the top of a note (frontmatter or first heading area) so searches and tag panes surface them consistently.
- Use combinations to express relationships, like `#character #faction` for organization leaders or `#location #dungeon` for keyed maps.
- Reserve wiki links for direct references to concrete notes (e.g., `[[02. Characters/Arin Dawncaller]]`) and rely on tags to provide cross-cutting views.

## How to use this vault
1. Start from `90._Templates` to create new notes; duplicate the relevant template and rename it.
2. File new notes in the matching top-level folder so structure stays predictable.
3. Tag notes immediately with the core categories above, and add subtype tags that clarify their role.
4. Link related notes with wiki links where a direct reference is needed, and let tags surface thematic clusters in the Tag Pane.
5. Keep session logs in `07. Sessions` and backlink them to characters, locations, and items they involve.
6. Store supporting images or handouts in `20. Assets`, and embed them in notes with Obsidian’s standard embed syntax.

This organization keeps the vault navigable while encouraging lightweight, tag-driven connections across the world of Sepsora.
