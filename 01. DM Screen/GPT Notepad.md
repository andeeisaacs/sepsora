Session 1:

# Opening

_Morning breaks over your campsite just outside of the **northern pass** of the **Greypeak Mountains**, a pass you've come to know through your travels together as a lesser known shortcut, cutting your travel time down significantly compared to the common route through the middle of the mountains that is favored by travelers, merchants and bandits alike.

You took camp last night just on the western exit, after your party made it out of the pass, along the edge of a several hundred foot drop sheer cliff. Easily defensible thanks to only a single ingress- and obscured by boulders and brush growth from the foot path just a few feet away. 

*The faint scent of last night's embers lingers on the crisp air, curled around your gear, tent and bedrolls like the essence a fading dream.* 

Optional: ==_(Arcturus)_ — The embers remind you of something else: a scent twisted with memory. Somewhere, far back, the Crooked One stirred in similar smoke, but that smoke smelled more of a certain type of charred meat. 

_One by one, you wake, stirring from your dreams to the warm light of daybreak as it is cast on your face and the chirps of birds. Someone nudges the next, a quiet chain reaction rousing of strange, unlikely group of a tight nit party of adventurers. 

bound by familiarity and as a way to not alarm the other. Before long, you’re breaking camp — folding tents, wrapping up bedrolls and kicking dirt over dying coals, adjusting straps and cloaks for the long road ahead._

_Today marks the beginning of the end of your **tenday** journey **west** — toward the Sword Coast’s crown jewel, **Waterdeep**. There, you'll sell your hard-won goods, replenish supplies, chase rumors, check in with guilds, family, and friends... and maybe if you haven't spent your newly acquired gold on booze and chasing various tail, you'll afford a real bed for a night or two._

**(Offer a single player a DC10 Nature check.

If successful, they catch the faintest, strange undertone on the breeze — the sharp and earthy yet fleeting scent of something they cant exactly make out. The smell is so brief that its hard to tell if you actually even smelled it.

Make note of their success: This hint grants them an automatic success later when investigating the overtaken village.)**

_(Zugusdeit)_ — If she succeeds, the scent triggers a half-memory, as if she's smelled this in a dream before.

#### **If players ask about surroundings:**

---

- _To the south lies **Orlbar** — a glorified waystation hugging the southern pass of the Greypeak Mountains. It would mean detouring southeast, away from the road to Waterdeep._

- _To the **north**, the dense, ancient boughs of the High Forest loom. The woods are thick, wild, and without a clear path, not a tempting option for travelers without purpose._

---

_You shoulder your packs and set off down the path. The lesser taken trail that has led you through the northern part of the Greypeaks stretches before you down the foothills— a dusty ribbon trail winding between rocky hills, the mountains shrinking behind you with each step that leads you just out beyond the town of **Loudwater**, and onto the known **Delimbiyr Route**. The route that will eventually bring you to The Sword Coast and your Waterdeep destination_. In your travels together, you found that this route has cut down on your travel time by skipping the whole of Loudwater, an overly zealot in the religious sense, town you've learned to just avoid if you can. 

_As you walk, the rhythmic crunch of boots on gravel fades to the background... and your mind drifts. Not to the road ahead — but to a road once traveled. 

A moment when you, (First character name) first realized you could trust (Character Name) with your life._ 

_(Begin baton-passing flashback sequence here.)_

## Entering Zelbross

*... As you come out of your memory, your legs still moving you subconsciously forward, the entrance to the ruined town you've all passed through before in your travels, its once glorious and welcoming archway welcome sign forces your eyes to glance up at it 

"**Zelbross**" it reads, in faded and peeling paint. A once bustling and promising settlement that lays ruined from wars of past turned makeshift trading outpost. 

*Due to the route passing through it, the river passing along it, the clay pools it offers and being the halfway mark between Loudwater and Secomber, it eventually became the perfect spot for merchants and travelers to stop and trade goods before setting off.*

*As you continue your journey on the route that travels down the middle of the town, you take note of the various merchant tents among the ruins of what was once the people of Zelbross' homes and businesses. The merchants taking these now empty spaces and filling it with open chests and tables with goods on display.* 

*You also take notice to the lighter than usual amount of foot traffic than you've seen in the past. A few less children playing, which depending on how you view it, may mean less worry about your coin purse becoming a bit lighter. 

There is a few less adventurers perusing the markets vendors as well but what really catches your eye is that seemingly placed anywhere that would fit to be within eye-line, are large handmade posters displaying a message written in common "**SCOUTING GROUP NEEDED IMMEDIATELY: EASY AND HIGH PAY! INQUIRE WITH HOLT!."* 

#### **If the players don't decide to look into the quest, have Tressa Holt notice them as they are passing through and flag them down.**

---

## The Merchant: [[Tressa Holt]]

> _You spot the merchant by the edge of the market square— a tall, slightly broad-shouldered woman leaning against several stacked crates, markings on the outside indicating pottery, shells, statuettes, etc. Her eyes scanning the square like she’s keeping inventory on everything that breathes._

> 

> _She wears a thick coat of ash-gray suede, cut high at the collar, with sleeves rolled to the elbow to show toned forearms and rings of old burn scars along her wrists. Her hair is pulled into tight braids, streaked with deep russet and ivory, cascading down one side like a coil of rope._

> 

> _She has tusks — not large, but clear — marking her as half-orcish, though the precision of her speech and the sharpness in her eyes suggest she’s been in enough cities to know when to bark and when to barter._

> _There’s a ledger tucked in one belt pouch, a skinning knife with a worn wooden handle in the other, and not a trace of patience on her face. She makes eye contact with you and her eyes widen just a bit more, like spotting a gem in the dirt, 

Optional: ==_(Johann)_ — Holt eyes your flair with mild disdain. You get the feeling she’s sized up sailors before, and not kindly.==

Optional: ==_(Arcturus)_ — She doesn't flinch when she sees you. That alone makes her notable.==

**Tressa will need to ask questions to find out the players are heading towards Waterdeep or they have to divulge that information before she offers the ride on the shipment carriage to Waterdeep.**

### The Quest

> _“The shipment I’m here to pick up was supposed to come from a shop, Moss & Hide, over in the northern quarter. Local family — hard workers, reliable through and through the years I've worked with them. They handle trade on my shipment from a small settlement in the forest.”_

> _“But when I showed up yesterday to Moss & Hide to collect my shipment, their doors were closed. Which never happens.”_

> _“I banged until someone answered. Mira, the mother,— tired eyes, worried face — she told me her brother hadn’t come in with the usual delivery. And then that her son... went looking.”_

> _“That was three days ago.”_

> _“I don’t think they’ll turn down help if you offer. And if you can bring anything back — the shipment, answers, good or bad, — I’ll pay you well **(if known where the players are going: "and get you on that caravan to Waterdeep.")** But I need to know something before this wagon rolls out tomorrow. 

> 

> Oh, and if they try to offer you gold, tell them Holt said to just focus on their family, I'll be the one paying you the coin. All six hundred of it. ”_

**If the players question whats in the shipment**

"What is it in the shipment? None of your fuckin' business to be honest. The only thing you need to be concerned with is finding out what happened to it and why its not here. Look, youll get paid"

**Holt will direct them to the northern quarter to a shop named Moss & Hide**

----

## Exterior of Moss and Hide:

The shop is ontop of rebuilt ruins of the **old** **Zelbross**. The ruins acts as the foundation (old stone building with newer wood and new stone piled ontop of the old and the roof is newly rebuilt) a modest shop with a smaller front of house for customers, while the back acts as living area for the family. 

## Interior of Moss & Hide:

- The shop is quiet. Smells of leather oil, tanned hide, and something earthy — truffles, probably.

- Wooden counter near the front, racks of leather goods, wood-carved goods, and baskets with spiced earthen grown produce such as potatoes, truffles of various types and even some Elven specialties.

- In the back, sounds of light hammering or scraping: someone working.

Optional: ==_(Zugusdeit)_ — As you enter, the aroma of herbs and tanning oils reminds you of the person who raised you — fleeting, but anchoring.== 

Optional: ==_(Hams)_ — You instinctively scan for traps or hidden storage. Old habits from the road.==

---

### **Mira Grayhall (Wood Elf mother):**

> _Mira carries herself with type of quiet strength — tall, slender, younger looking than she actually is with sun-darkened olive skin and silver-flecked auburn hair tied back in a leather cord. Her eyes are a calm, leaf-green, above sharp cheekbones, but they flick toward the door every few minutes, as if always expecting someone to walk through it._

### **Nola Grayhall (Half-Elf Daughter, early 20s):**

> _Nola wears a leather apron stained with truffle dust and tanning oil. She has Mira’s sharp cheekbones and Harlan’s quiet intensity. Her long dark hair is braided back tightly, and she works with precise, focused movements — keeping herself busy like it’s the only thing keeping her from unraveling._.

---

## 🧩 Dialogue

### 🗣️ **Mira Grayhall Greets Them**:

> *As you open the door to the shop, a bell gently jingles as the door hits it, catching the attention of a tall, slender, woman with sun-darkened olive skin and silver-flecked auburn hair that is tied back with a leather cord. 

> 

> She turns her head sharply to look at you with something more than excitement for a new customer, its almost like she is expectant of someone, but then a subtle type of sadness washes over her face, quickly forced away into a poorly rehearsed customer service mask. Her eyes scans each one of your faces.*

>

> ***Mira**: "Sorry, we're closed. That door was supposed to be locked.. "*

> 

> *Before she can finish her sentence, she is interrupted by a young adult woman also behind the counter, her back towards all of you but has her head turned towards the older woman, giving a clear view of her **Elven** heritage that the point in her ears provides.* 

> 

> ***Nola**: "Sorry, mom, my fault.. I just figured we should keep the shop open in case..."**

> ***Mira**: "It's alright **Nola**, I appreciate it."*

> 

> ***Nola** resumes stocking the shelves with product, tiding the display of goods. The older woman looks at you-* 

> **Mira**: _“.. you don't look like you're here to purchase hides or truffles. You with **Holt? ”_ 

==_(Zugusdeit)_ — Mira meets your eyes with quiet understanding — not pity. It’s subtle, but you recognize it as the look of someone who’s survived worse than she speaks of.==

***after confirmation from the players**

_“Holt's a good woman, a loyal customer, and even better friend. Better than most. Said she'd be sending someone by.”_*

> She drops the customer service facade, "I'm **Mira**. That's, **Nola**, my daughter, and in the back is **Harlen**, my husband. ”_ she gestures vaguely to the opening in the wall behind the counter, where a curtain hangs to provide semblance of privacy and division. 

*In the back of the shop, sunlight beams in through an open back door. The sound of an axe can be heard chopping wood. Then a dull thud of said axe being dropped into the soil followed by footsteps walking in through the door. A large male figure can be half-seen behind the curtains that gently sway from the breeze and provide glimpses. He's sitting down at a tanners frame now, starting to work on a hide that has been stretched.* 

> _ **Mira**: “My brother, **Calen** brings **Holt's** goods from **Brindlewild, where he lives. A bit inside the southern part of **The High Forest**. We share profits since he brings Holt's shipment specifically and- well..”_ 

> 

> **She pauses for a moment, letting her gaze shift from who she's speaking with to a window in the foreground over their shoulder**

> 

> _“He should’ve been here four days ago. Its only a half days journey from there, but he didn't show. Nor did any word. Its not like him." 

**Mira gives a sharp inhale,** 

> "My son, **Erel**, left three days back to check on him. He didn’t say much, but he had that look — the one he gets when he's determined about something. Same look he gets when he knows he's about to be told no. But he left in the morning before we opened shop. Took his leather cloak and the bow his uncle gave him.”_

**_(She pauses to keep her voice steady.)_** 

> _“No one’s come back from that way in days. No new carts, no hunters, no foragers. No travelers like you.”_

> _“... please. Just tell us if you find them. And if you don’t...”_

> **_(She trails off, swallows, and forces a smile.)_** 

> _“**Holt** said not to pay you. Said we should keep the coin. Said we might need it. I’m not sure I like that... but I understand. She's being kind by not demanding the shipment of truffles to be compensated or letting us pay you directly.”_

**If players show kindness, or manage a skill check success- Mira will offer them each to take anything they want in lieu of coin**.

(Loot table needed here that is appropriate for the player levels and the theme of the shop.)

## Directions to Brindlewild

🗣️ **Mira Provides the directions via family trail shortcut:

> _“Head north straight towards the forest edge. You can head out the back door. At the edge of the trees, there’s an old **cairn** by brother set up years ago — moss-covered, weathered. That’s your marker.”_ 

> _“Go straight into the woods behind the cairn. The path’s not carved, more of a desire line you need to look for, but it’s there. **Calen** never used the route through **Uluvin** , the ones travelers use— said they wasted half a day.”_ _“If you hit the river, you’ve gone too far and missed **Brindlewild**.”_

---

### **Nola Grayhall (Half-Elf Daughter, early 20s):**

> _Nola wears a leather apron stained with truffle dust and tanning oil. She has Mira’s sharp cheekbones and Harlan’s quiet intensity. Her long dark hair is braided back tightly, and she works with precise, focused movements — keeping herself busy like it’s the only thing keeping her from unraveling._

- _“He said I shouldn’t go. Said one of us needed to stay here. Told him dad would be pissed and he'd worry mom...” **brief pause** “I should’ve gone with him.” 

- *"If you go, look for signs of him. He always leaves subtle hints like a tree marking, a message or the likes in case he's ever in trouble later. Something his uncle taught him to do when hunting alone."*

---

### **Harlan Grayhall( Human father):**

> _Harlan is broad-shouldered and sun-leathered, with crow’s feet around sharp eyes and a thick salt-and-pepper beard. His hands are wide and thick with calluses, stained with oils and dyes, and he moves with the weight of someone who doesn’t waste time — even when the world’s giving him reasons to stop._

**If the players question Harlan, or if they set out without talking to him, have Harlan catch up, offer some supplies, say below and immediately walk away back to what he was doing at the shop after saying the following.**

**_(Harlan stops working for just a second, runs up with a satchel over his shoulder and staring down at the tool in his hand like he forgot what he was doing.)_**

> _"Listen, Calen’s not some wandering fool. He’s a provider. Hunter, gatherer — damn good at both."_

> _"He’s been making the trip from Brindlewild to here every seven days for the last eleven years. Rain, wind, sickness — doesn’t matter. Always showed up with a full pack and a smart ass mouth."_v

> _"I don't know if he left the settlement or not, or if bandits caught up to him or he tried to take on an animal too big for him.. but he should’ve been here five days ago. My son adores him, wants to be just like him one day.. its why he took off to look for his gods damn uncle without saying a word to me or Mira, strong willed and smart. Knew we'd say no. "_

> **_(A pause. His voice is even, but a little quieter.)_** 

> _"Man like Calen doesn’t just disappear. Same goes for my son. 

> Look, If you cant bring them both home, just.. bring me answers at least."_

Optional: ==_(Hams)_ — Harlan’s pragmatism mirrors your own. When he talks about Calen’s reliability, it pings something in your mind- It kind of clicks, that this is the kind of man you respect.==

*** **Harlan** un-shoulders a satchel and holds it out.*** 

"For your travels."

**(Loot table of what he provides the players here if he runs up to talk to them)**

# The High Forest

*Your journey north to the forest line is uneventful, and before long , one of you notices a cairn, just as Mira described. Moss covered and small, sits between and in-front of two trees. Had you not been looking for it you and at the angle you approached, it would have easily been overlooked along with the passage between the two trees that offers you hidden ingress*

# **Journey to Brindlewild – Mood and Mechanics**

### 🎧 **Atmosphere as they enter the woods:**

- Once players pass the cairn and begin moving into the forest proper, describe a **sudden drop in ambient sound**:

- No birds.

- No insects.

- Just wind through the canopy and the occasional creak of an old tree.

- Footsteps feel loud. Breathing feels loud. It's unnatural.

> _“ After about twenty to thirty minutes of walking single file into the forest, over overgrown tree roots, past brush, descending and ascending the various plateaus- The deeper in you walk, the quieter the world becomes — an unnerving silence. Even your own footsteps and breath seem to echo a little too much between the trunks.”_

_(Hams)_ — The stillness isn't predator quiet. It’s _wrong_ quiet. Your hand gets this itch to want to grab the hilt of your weapon, its instinctive... 

_(Johann)_ — You’ve walked through ancient groves, you've sailed to far away hidden forests.. This isn’t one. This forest feels.. off..

---

### 🧠 **Perception/Survival Checks (Creeping Presence):**

| DC | Outcome |

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| PER **DC 10-15** | Spot a humanoid shape briefly at a distance — just between the trees, passing between two trunks— but it’s gone when you look again. Seemed to be moving **west or south** (**Secret DM Note: This is infected Calen moving towards the town.)** |

| SUR **DC 15 - 18** | Smell something wrong. Not decay. Not rot. Something **wet and warm** beneath the bark. Like breath held too long in a sealed room. |

Let it hit one or two players, not the whole party — and only once. No second sightings. Just discomfort.

---

### 🧩 Optional Clues while traveling. 

- **Nature/Arcana DC 17**

- White mold growing on the _sunny_ side of a tree (not normal).

- **DC 15 Survival/Nature**

_“One of you catches a faint disturbance in the underbrush — a thin branch twisted into a spiral and tucked carefully into the crook of a tree’s root system.”_ 

_“It’s not random. Someone placed it deliberately — and recently. Moss hasn’t started to grow back where the ground was disturbed.”_

"*You remember Nola mentioning that Erel used to leave signals when he ventured deep into the woods — a habit learned from his uncle Calen, she said. Quiet marks, subtle and natural, just in case his family ever came looking*"

**Discovery: A small flat stone with a charcoal mark scratched into it (a direction or a time). If they pick up the flat stone, the backside is slick with slime**

---

# **Brindlewild – Arrival**

---

## 🧱 **Before the Wall (First Glimpse from the Trail)**

> _The trees thin ahead, allowing you to glimpse open sky for the first time in a while. The setting sun casts a warm light over the clearing beyond — a grassy incline spread before you like an old, forgotten pasture._

> 

> _Where the forest ends, a modest field begins. Fallow rows stretch outward, choked with weeds. Dead vines coil in shallow furrows, and small wooden pins stand empty — meant for animals that clearly haven’t grazed in days._

> 

> _A worn footpath splits the field, leading to a break in a low stone wall that rings the hill. There’s no gate, no signage, no welcome — just stones, lichen-spotted and half-sunken in the earth. The footpath winds through and ascends the hill ahead._

> 

> _From here, you spot a crooked silo and a slanted barn, its thatched roof half-covered in moss. One or two homes lie beyond, barely visible beyond the curve of the path. The whole place feels still. Watched. Like a breath held too long._

### **Skill Check Opportunities (Before Wall):**

- **Group Perception/Investigation DC 10–15**:

- _You notice nothing here’s been tended for a while. No tools in the fields. No footprints. No birdsong. Just wind._

- _A strange yellowish haze tints the world — not thick, but enough to make everything not in your immediate vicinity feel... old._

- **DC 5 Survival/Investigation**:

- _You spot a scrap of leather, recently tanned, caught on a fence post. Fresh. Not placed. Dropped in a hurry._

---

## 🌫️ **Beyond the Threshold (Crossing into Brindlewild)**

> _As you step past the broken stones, the air changes. Not colder. Not warmer. Just... heavier. Like humidity that’s clung to your skin without you noticing._

> 

> _Then it hits: the smell. Not rot. Not death. Something almost floral. Sweet. Spoiled. Like wilted petals left in the sun too long — thick, wet, and warm. It coats your tongue, clings to your teeth._

> 

> _(If they succeeded on the earlier campsite check:)_ 

> _You’ve smelled this before. Back at camp. Barely a hint of it on the wind. Now? It’s all around you. And it’s stronger._

> (_Arcturus)_ — The floral rot on the air is unnerving.. for a brief moment you feel like you are back to where you were once dumped and left for dead..

> _Boots crunch on brittle grass as the hill crests. What catches your eye is that moss you saw covering the structures from before the hill... as you approach you notice something off about it. 

> 

> _Its not moss. Its not web either, atleast nothing you've ever seen before. Its pale, veined, mucous-like — coils over rooftops and walls. Bulbous growths swell in the eaves. Thin, wet looking, membranes stretch between the structures, some clinging to the ground, others webbed above your head like the strands of a grotesque vine. It reaches for everything around it, and connects in what could only be described as vein like tubes_

> 

> Dust puffs softly from cracks in wooden frames. The barn and the nearby house are connected — not by planks or fences, but by strange, swamp like, sparse tissue growth._

---

### 💀 **Body Horror – The Barn Wall**

> When you start to pass the barn, your eye catches the view of a partial humanoid like figure. 

> 

> _A woman’s face emerges from the siding beside the barn door. Or... what’s left of one. Her mouth hangs open, frozen mid-gasp. The whites of her eyes are yellowed and bloodshot, her sockets sunken. From the back of her head, gill-like fungal growths bloom like a grotesque crown._

> 

> _One arm has been pulled into the frame — not pinned, not broken, but _absorbed_. Her fingers splay into the wood, the tips missing their nails and transformed into a tangled mass of sinew and organic growth, worming through the cracks in the door and frame. Her other arm melds into the wall a the elbow. 

> 

> _The rest of her lower body is all but missing, its stretched. Reabsorbed. A suggestion of shape of her lower half remains — like a wax figure that was thrown at incredible speeds at the wall and splattered, but thats not what happened here. There is no gore, there is no blood, just undulating webbing spreading out across the wall, ceiling and ground.

> 

As you examine the remains of this person, her eye snaps to the side and looks directly at you. Intently focused and following your movements._

### **Medicine/Investigation Check DC 14+**

- _You catch the detail: her pupil contracts and expands, again and again. A rhythmic pulsing, too precise to be natural._

*if Player decides to interact or get VERY close to the woman, give a infection token*

---

### 🕷️ **Tactile DM Note (If players touch the membrane or mold):**

> _The surface is slick and warm. It gives under your touch — not like moss, but like skin with too much water under it. Then it pulses. Just once. As if... it felt you back._

---

### 🩸 **Crawling Remains (On path toward Brindlewild’s east side):**

> _Something stirs in the tall grass ahead. A set of legs connected to a pelvis — no torso, no blood, just two legs lying side by side connected by what seems to be a melted pelvis, fused into a fan of pulsing color where they meet the ground and spreads out like feelers cutting through the grass._

> 

> _They move gently, slowly, uselessly. As if trying to crawl forward, in attempt to move down the path carved into the hill to the rest of the modest gathering of homes — but they are fused too tightly to the web of membrane beneath to move more than a few inches and then come to rest exactly where it was before._

_(**DC 13 Perception):_** 

> _The legs are humanoid. Smaller than adult, larger than dwarf. The clothing it wears gives indication of carefree playful youth, childlike. 

---

### 🏠 **Subtle Foreshadowing – Calen’s House**

> _Farther away, on the other side of the hill, the landscape slopes down, mostly hidden behind the brush, sparse tree and haze, one house seems less overtaken than the others. Its roof has gaps, its siding is bowed, but the growth hasn’t fully consumed it._

---

## 🏚️ **Calen’s House – The Final Home**

> _You descend the rise into what feels like the forgotten edge of Brindlewild — a house perched at the tail end of the settlement, removed just enough to delay its complete overtaking._

### 🧠 Player Perception/Investigation Opportunities

- **Perception DC 12**: 

_You spot faint boot tracks in the muck — one adult-sized, another smaller. The adult tracks leave the house. The smaller ones end at the front door._

- **Investigation DC 13**: 

_The fungal growth on this house is thinner. Not absent — just not advanced. Unlike the other buildings, the mold here hasn't fully sealed the structure shut._

---

### 🪞 **The Exterior**

The house stands hunched beneath a curtain of hanging moss and sinewed membrane. The door is cracked open two inches. Inside, dim golden light leaks from a single fungal pustule, casting weird shadows.

> Through the gap in the door, you catch a glimpse of something lying on the warped floorboards: **a recurved elven bow** resting awkwardly on the ground, strands of puffball fungus exhaling small clouds with every breeze.

#### 🎲 Player Options:

- **Attempt to enter through the door:**

- **Small-sized character**: Can squeeze in (no check). Gains **1 Infection Token** for contact exposure.

- **Medium+ character**: DC 14 Strength (Athletics) to shoulder through the membrane.

- On success, gain **2 Infection Tokens** from spore exposure.

- On fail, stuck — advantage on next attempt but risk alerting creatures outside.

- **Attempt the window:**

- DC 12 Acrobatics or Dexterity check to climb through safely.

- Success: You slip in and may unlock the front door from inside.

- You gain **1 Infection Token**.

#### 🧪 Optional: Arcana/Nature DC 15

_Reveals that the membrane reacts to motion and pressure — a network, not individual growths. It might have "nerves."_

---

### 🕯️ **Interior – The Creep of Growth**

> The inside of the house is warped by fungal overgrowth. What once might have been a modest kitchen, living space, and sleeping quarters are now strangled with pulsing mycelium. Furniture is fused to the walls or half-reabsorbed into them. Hallways twist unnaturally, narrowed to tunnels carved by time and decay.

Let the players explore:

#### 📦 **Exploration Opportunities:**

- **DC 12 Perception (Kitchen area)**: 

Find **Calen’s hunting knife**, half-fused into a cutting block. It's a +1 dagger with a leather-wrapped hilt that resists fungal corrosion.

- **DC 14 Investigation (Living space)**: 

Uncover a **leatherbound field journal** with pressed truffle spore prints, elven shorthand notes, and **a sketch of Brindlewild with coded trail markers**. (Provides advantage on future navigation checks through High Forest or similar terrain.)

- **DC 15 Arcana (Bedroom)**: 

Identify a **spore-slicked charm** hanging from the ceiling: A minor magical token that can cast _Detect Poison and Disease_ once per long rest. Touching it gives 1 Infection Token.

---

### 🎯 **Erel’s Bow and the Horror Above**

As the players move to recover the **bow** on the floor:

> _The house suddenly feels too quiet. The air is thick and wet. Then comes the sound — slow, ragged **breathing**. Not coming from behind or around you... but **above**._

> _You look up. And see him._

> _**Erel** is affixed to the ceiling like a grotesque tapestry — his back faces you, his chest pressed against the ceiling, his skin and muscle has been exposed and where spine should mee the ribs is splayed open, ribs stretched and bent open, vines and mold gently pulsing around organs that are still functioning — barely. His jaw slack, held open by fibrous growths weaved between his teeth, holding his tongue down. The wheezing breath rasps from between ruined vocal cords and wet lungs worked like bellows by fungal veins. His head is turned in an impossible direction to be facing you and his eyes... are open. And watching._

---

### 🧠 Player Reactions

- **Medicine DC 14**: 

_He’s not alive — but he’s not fully dead. His heart beats. His lungs inflate. But none of it is _his_. The fungus is performing him like a puppet._

- **Insight DC 12**: 

_There’s a faint twitch — recognition. Maybe he knows you’re here. His pulsing pupils track any foreign movements in the room, but the eyelids never bink_ 

- **Optional Horror Sanity Rule**: 

Characters who fail a DC 13 Wisdom save gain 1 point of Short-Term Madness (Frightened for 1 round, elect to take disadvantage on their initiative, with infection die bolstering).

---

### 🎒 **Calen's Satchel**

Near the exit lies a satchel — torn open, contents scattered as though dropped in haste.

Inside:

- **A rust color-stained waterskin** (contaminated)

- **A weatherproof scroll tube** (contains a map with marked safe trails)

- **A bundle of crushed mushrooms** – Identifiable with DC 15 Nature as _not native_ to the region (The infection is not just spreading, it’s _foreign_).

- **A sealed pouch of dry medicinal herbs** — still usable for making an antidote if the party pursues that path.

---

# 🐺 **Encounter Trigger – Fungal Wolves**

Five minutes after the players begin exploration:

> _A distant howl. Wet. Distorted. Followed by another. Then closer._

A pack of **fungal-infected wolves** stalks the house. Choose one:

- **Option A – Encounter Outside**: 

Wolves surround the house. Players must defend or escape.

- **Option B – Encounter Inside**: 

Wolves force entry. Use tight spaces, windows, and choke points for tactical depth.

🧱 Stats: Use **Wolf stat block**, but add:

- Resistance to piercing/slashing from nonmagical weapons.

- On bite: DC 11 Con save or gain 1 Infection Token.

---

### 🧟 **Corrupted Hill Giant**

As the players leave:

> _A loud crack. A nearby house, overtaken by massive fungal pustules, shifts. A slow tearing sound. Wood groans. Then — it moves._

Emerging from the fungal husk is a **Corrupted Hill Giant**, half-fused with the building it grew inside.

- **Weakness Mechanic**: Exposed fungal nodes on its chest/back can be targeted for double damage (DC 15 Perception or Investigation to spot).

- **Goal**: Motivate **flight over fight**, but reward creative tactics or risk-taking.

- **Sound cue**: Guttural moan, and as it lumbers after them, it breaks parts of nearby buildings unintentionally, creating terrain hazards.

LOOT: 

Find **Calen’s hunting knife**, half-fused into the giant's achilies tendon, requiring a DC 10 strength check to pull it out. It's an elven curved bladed dagger, silvered with beautiful etching on it, with leather-wrapped hilt that has small darkend pocks where mold has rotted its aesthetics. 

---

### 🏃 **Escape Options**

- **Run back through the forest** — triggering another infection hazard zone.

- **Try to hide** — DC 18 Stealth group check.

- **Use the house as a trap** — collapse it on the giant (DC 17 Int or Enginuity check + supporting skill).

If they do flee — read the following:

> _Behind you, the sounds of ruin echo — the fungal giant roaring as it tears through what’s left of Brindlewild. It doesn’t seem interested in you anymore. 

---

Returning to Zelbross, if they choose to fight they will likely need to take a short rest or they can run full speed and make it back. When the players break the tree line, its fully night time, but the sky glows over Zelbross. When the players arrive at Zelbross they will find corrupted Drow and forrest creatures attacking. Half of the merchants and people who live in Zelbross are taken by the fungus and are attacking eachother, fires in various places, the same kind of haze they saw at Brindlewild creeping in. 

- Possible ending option 1 (if the players try to enter town): The players are grabbed by Tess and told the town is lost and that they need to get to her carriage on the other side of town. She is making good on her promise and just wants to get out alive with what she has. 

- Possible Ending Option 2 (if the players try to avoid Zelbross): Tess rides up with her carriage and tells the players to get on, with Nola and Mira in the back. Nola is conscious, while Mira is mortally wounded and unconscious. 

**END SESSION.** 

Picking up where Session 1 left off: Rolling initiative and gaining the 3rd level for their subclasses. They were told to roll initiative as the Fungal Corrupted Hill Giant creaked and groaned its way out of the collapsed house rubble. The wolves will be revealing themselves from behind Calen's house. If players do not leave the house immediately, the wolves can come in through windows to kind of 'push' the players out.

Prep TODO: 

- Assist players with their character sheet to level to 3.

- COMPLETE: Use [[2.5 Encounter 1]] for the encounter with the wolves, hill-giant and the other possible corrupted woodland creatures. 

- The first player to already reach their threshold is Johann, who has been gun-ho on trying to burn all of the fungus corruption.

- Build Corrupted Cow stat-block.

- Build out Murmuration awakening for Pact of the Blade.

- Build out Arcturus's Patron, Kronos's interest in the new corruption as he appeared momentarily to him as they entered the town. 

- Build out 2-3 small encounters in Zelbross

- Build out Zelbross in ruins.

- Build out Cart travel

- Build out Nola telling the story of what happened up till her fleeing to find Tess, who came and witnessed Mira performing the death blow on Harlan.

- Build out Mira succumbing to her fatal injuries

- Build out the environment- The sky is alight with fires, blooms in the air. They are not outrunning it, they are catching up to it. 

- Possible encounter?

- Long rest on the cart. 

- Build out Secomber, the first stop in travel on the cart.

- Meet with authorities

- Discover information about Drows coming out of the forest.

- They have one 

- Reports of twisted animals and a hill giant onslaught on the town to the north, Ulvil. 

- The players will need to flee the battle. We do not want to kill them but we want to be pushing them out of the village back towards the path to Zelbross they came by.

- Once the players break the tree-line of the High Forest and can see Zellbross they will be met with the trading hub/settlement in the midst of chaos due to the spread of the Myconid spore 'infection' taking over.

- Try to get around the town from the outskirts, which depending on if they keep a wide berth or stay close, they will run into [[Tressa Holt]] by her finding them, or them coming upon her attempting to flee the town, she will beckon them to get on the cart. 

- Enter the town, and be grabbed by [[Tressa Holt]], wanting to get them to her cart that had arrived a short time ago, but they will need to travel through the camp to get to the cart.

- Once on the cart, find Mira and Nola stashed in the back trying to keep low and fleeing with the players.

# Pre-session WARM-UP

---

In character- 

- What is the first thing someone would notice about you?

- What about your clothes, gear, or bearing shows who you _used_ to be?

- What sound do your footsteps make when walking down a gravel road?

- What smell follows you?

- Do you think you would stick close to someone when entering a dungeon hallway you've never explored before? 

- Would you take charge, or walk two abreast? 

- Perhaps you'd guard the rear?

- Hang back in the previous room until the all clear is given?

- What are you doing with your hands while walking?

- How do you feel about silence? When noone is talking, do you pipe up? How do you do it?

# Last session recap

---

> After crossing the Greypeak Mountains and awakening at your camp you traveled down the road you've traversed countless times with the sam, the party followed a lead on a missing shipment tied to Holt and the Grayhall family business. Their investigation led them through eerily quiet woods and into the nestled away village of Brindlewild—where a strange growth or corruption has taken hold.

> 

> The village residents seemingly being 'claimed' or some-sort of grotesque assimilation with the dwellings and land. The village itself gently moving, breathing and overgrown- pulsing with a type of life. 

> 

> Some of you found it fascinating, some of you were repulsed. Some of you tried to divine what this is, with little or no success. Some of you saw it as a reason to cleanse the area, although ill-advised. But you remembered your task, to find Calen and young Erel. You located the apparent dwellings of Calen and finally… the body of young Erel Grayhall, fused to the ceiling of abode. Not dead, but certainly not alive in any traditional sense. 

> 

> Then, distant howls growing closer.

> 

> A cracking of crust and the twisting of wood. 

> 

> Then a malformed shape of a **hill giant** wielding a partial tree trunk as a makeshift club rose from the neighboring ruined building as various twisted shapes of woodland animals started to close in on the backside of Calens house. 

> 

> And then…

# The Crooked One 

---

>The 20 foot hill giant risin, rotting fungus, mushroom falling from him with plumes of dusty spores being agitated into flight, but **something happens for you and only you Arcturus.** 

>As you ready yourself to fight alongside your companions you've come to know and trust you notice it- its a smell that rises above the sweet and sickly honey corruption scent that permeates the area. 

> This smell is the smell you are intimately familiar with. Its that damp burnt meat smell. Your facial burn scar tissue starts to ache. 

> All while this is happening to you- the world around you slows down to a creeping pace. The smoke and plumes of fungal dust once dancing on the wind stops in place. All movement from everything and everyone but you holds in suspended animation.

>Without a doubt, you know it now. 

>It's **Him**. He's **here**. 

*Using dark low drawl character voice*, broken- **GMAN**: 

> Tsk Tsk, ***Arcturus***. Almost died.. *again*... I see. 

> You know, the last time we spoke, I found you in a similar situation.. 

> Letting someone you trusted of your.. court.. making movements to send you to a charred grave

When looked at, he is hard to focus on, its like your eyes want to divert away. Like forcing your eyes to stay open when looking at the sun, but you can see him raise a hand and pointing a single finger at Johann, referencing to his general direction lazily as he walks forward and under him. 

> That's just bad form, ***Elderflower***. We need you in... much better shape if we are to execute on our *contractual* obligations. 

You feel the knowledge of new power entering your mind, your patron granting you new abilities you didnt have mere moments ago. You feel stronger, able to withstand the pain a bit more, and dish it out. (This is your level up to 3.)

>Do try to survive.. whatever this (*once again gesturing, now broadly to the scene before you of the growths and corruption*).. is. 

>

>But I do have to say, It is most fascinating, I can feel it trying to resist me right now. Like its aware. Like it thinks it can bend the will of my domain, time, as easily as it bends life. 

> And little Deepwater? Do be more cautious. I do loathe when people squander *my gifts*.

Everything resumes in time. 

**Start "Slay the Spire soundtrack"**

## **ROLL INITIATIVE!!!!!!!!**

---

**Note: Arcturus rolled nat20** (Double check rules on that.)

Run [[2.5 Encounter 1]]

Play "Slay the Spire soundtrack"

**IF TPK IS IMMINENT:**

Ordering the Spore— Infection-Stirred Distraction**

**Trigger:** If a player has reached milestone threshold, have the giant and the other woodland animals stop attacking, the ruined village houses all wheeze out plumes of spores into the air, making visibility -and re-prioritize an invisible and silent signal to ignore the players and move back into the forest. 

**Effect:** It’s not mercy—it’s priority. Something worse is calling them. 

> “The giant’s pulls his arm up, ready to slam down and crush you but suddenly halts mid-swing. Then, all at once, the creatures turn their attention away—like hounds catching a stronger scent, or a silent whistle being blown, they all immediately turn towards the nearby woods and start hastfully departing into the tree obscurities”

---

# The Path Back

> The silence swells, not as peace, but as pressure. The kind that settles behind the eyes and between the ribs. Every breath feels borrowed. Every glance behind you, a risk. You survived, but barely. 

*Ask the party for a table perception check. **DC 10**

> Just within a few minutes of walking back onto the path that brought you to Brindlewild, it catches your eye. You see it *this time*, Hanging from a low, snapped branch just ahead — swaying slightly in the cold air — is a **satchel**. 

>

>Worn leather, the stitching frayed at the edges, an embossing in the corner bearing the faint design of a small bow and knife.

>

It was here when you passed this way before, but now you can see it because it was on the wrong side of the tree. 

>The strap is torn, not cut. The break looks fresh, And there's a faint smudge of rust-colored residue across the top flap.

>As you draw closer, the satchel catches the light like a sheen — not a metal glint. A thin layer of pale yellow dust clings to the torn leather *like pollen*. 

>The forest doesn’t react. The satchel just waits, turning slowly in the smoke and dust heavy air of the High Forest.

*Once the player grabs the satchel:

> The dust breaks free from the treated animal hide leather, hovering in the moonlight for just a moment before blowing away into the forest. 

[[Calen's Satchel]]

# Continue: Returning to Zelbross

----

**(Survival DC 14)** 

Tracks and bent foliage confirm a figure moved swiftly, but unsure footedly, through here recently, falling on and off the path before the tracks dissappear into the dense forest heading south, south west.

**(Survival DC 18)** 

What you find interesting, is there are a lot of various creatures foot prints, all overlaping eachother, each of them crossing the path but this particular set is fresher than the rest, and moving in a different direction. 

** Johann's nose starts to drip something wet. Warm. Blood. Roll on [[🦠 Infection Tracker – Sepsora Campaign (DM-Only)]]]

---

# Reaping the Harvest

---

Break from tree line of the high forest back to [[Zelbross]]

-the night sky has low clouds obstructing the moon.. or is that smoke. Its a haze that is lit from the ground. Fires, but not of camp, or of torches. Of the various merchant carts and tents and rebuilt establishments.

- Distant screams, sounds of running and various window glass breaking and the 'FWOOM' of fires spreading to new accellerants, are heard. 

- The settlement is once again crumbling to ruins. The fires flickering on walls cast shadows of fighting. 

What Do you Do?

---

# Through Zelbross

- If players immediately go to Moss and Hide, have [[Tressa Holt]] show up quickly, looking for them and try to guide them out to the west exit where her cart has been waiting to depart in the morning. Explain in short what happened in their absence: 

- **Calen** returned, different, in a daze. 

- Eventually attacked **Harlan**, and when **Harlan** defended, **Calen** burst into spores.

- **Harlan**, having been the closest person to **Calen**, collapsed, went unconscious for awhile, stood up and started acting strange as well. After some time, he attacked **Mira** and while defending she told Nola to get Tess. 

- While gone, Mira became mortally wounded by Harlan (large gash in her side, rib exposed, but not bleeding much) 

- Harlan's corpse, after a short period, started melding into the ground, skin ruptured and started to spread out like an rapidly mobile slime mould.

---

### Encounter 1 — Northern Quarter: _Family Torn Apart_

**Set-Up:** 

As you approach the familiar northern quarter, screams puncture the eerie quiet. Outside a modest house, a corrupted humanoid—once an elderly man—looms over two terrified villagers, his torso ruptured with fungal tendrils that lash wildly, reaching for them. 

**Enemies:**

- **Corrupted Elder** (Commoner stats with added fungal tendril attack: +3 to hit, 1d4 bludgeoning +1 poison damage)

**Scene Details:**

- One victim is already fallen, partially merged with fungal growth.

- A second villager is cornered, pleading for help.

- The corrupted elder is slow, awkwardly moving, driven by unnatural instincts.

What happened:

If the players decided to enter town, have Tess try to guide them through while explaining what has happened while they were gone. 

- **Calen** returned, different, in a daze. 

- Eventually attacked **Harlan**, and when **Harlan** defended, **Calen** burst into spores.

- **Harlan**, having been the closest person to **Calen**, collapsed, went unconscious for awhile, stood up and started acting strange as well. After some time, he attacked **Mira** and while defending she told Nola to get Tess. 

- While gone, Mira became mortally wounded by Harlan (large gash in her side, rib exposed, but not bleeding much) 

- Harlan's corpse, after a short period, started melding into the ground, skin ruptured and started to spread out like an rapidly mobile slime mould.

# Session 3 - Return

## Recap

----

> Just after sunset, the party learned what the 'wrong sounds' belonged to they heard when they arrived to the small forest village of Brindlewild. 

> 

> Time slowed to a crawl and afforded Arcturus a rare meeting before the fight that would ensue, a chance to speak with The Crooked One who showed great interest in what was happening there. They left Arcturus with a scolding for allowing themselves to be harmed by Johann's actions, a warning to not break their contract by dying, granting of promised power and a singular piece of advice: Survive or be consumed as per pact agreement. 

> 

> After surviving a deadly encounter with a malformed hill giant, various gruesome visages of what something thinks a wolf should be and a space-invading cow, the creatures were seemingly called by an unseen or perhaps unheard command, causing them to lose interest in the fight and head north down the main road inside the High Forest, leading them away from the ruined and overgrown village.

> 

> **This wasn't an act of mercy It’s not mercy on their behalf—it’s an act of prioritization.** 

> 

> Not wanting to stick around any longer than needed, you left the settlement via the way you arrived to return to Zelbross with urgency to inform the family of Erel's demise and the corruption that took over, claim your reward and get on Holt's promised merchant cart ride that would significantly cut down your travel time back home. 

> 

> On the return path the ***tall-for-a-halfling ranger*** in the party noticed that there was a distinct set of tracks leading off path, and a satchel caught on a low hanging branch- not left there by choice, but seemingly caught by someone rushing off path and into the forest.

> 

> On first gleaning inside the satchel, it revealed various survival goods one might find for a hunter, but most intriguingly was a field journal, belonging to Calen, that recorded the mundane previous months of hunting followed by a discovered passage to the Underdark, strange occurrences in the forest and a mysterious appearance of a Drow clad with Lolth warrior garb in broad daylight acting unusually calm and unresponsive in Brindlewild. The journal's dated logs ended just short of when Calen would be arriving with the delivery for Moss & Hide. 

> 

Now you've broken the treeline and are now witnessing the scene of Zelbross mid emergency. A in-recent-years bustling trade hub settlement now being brought to ruin once again with the sounds of death and fighting, smoke surrounding the settlement due to buildings and person building, the sickly sweet smell you've encountered before and the sinking feeling in your gut that this is somehow related.

***what do you do?***

# **CURRENT SITUATION (read verbatim):** 

> You stagger from the forest under the shroud of midnight. The stars overhead are blurred by drifting smoke, and Zelbross lies ahead, bathed in patches of pale moonlight and deep shadow. Even from here, you can see movement—slow and wrong—amongst the buildings, and the scent of damp, moldy decay hangs thickly in the still, cool air. Somewhere inside waits Holt, your promised reward, and your escape.

---

### ⚖️ **PLAYER DECISION POINT (read verbatim):**

> **You face a choice:**

> 

> - You can **try to give Zelbross a wide berth**, creeping carefully along the darkened outskirts, hoping to avoid notice and reach Holt unnoticed—but moving slowly and risking detection at every step.

> 

> - Or you can **move swiftly through Zelbross**, directly facing whatever horrors now inhabit the town’s corrupted heart, potentially cutting precious time off your escape—but inviting greater danger.

> 

**(Pause here for player choice.)**

Take the Wide[[03. Berth]]

Take the ingress: 

> **SITUATION:** Zelbross is visibly in crisis. Smoke rises, fungal blooms scatter on the wind, and strange lights flicker inside the ruined quarter. Something is wrong—_very wrong_—but Tressa Holt and their only way out may still be inside.

---

### ✅ PHASE ONE: PLAYER CHOICE

After cresting out of the forest path, the party must choose:

- **A) Wide Berth Sneak**: Circle the outer edges to avoid danger.

- **B) Push Through Zelbross**: Move directly through the ruined heart.

---

# 🅰️ WIDE BERTH: Sneaking Around Zelbross

**Goal:** Reach Holt’s cart (still hitched and waiting) _without being noticed_ by whatever is inside the town.

### ❗Tension Framing (Callout for Verbatim Use)

> The wind shifts, and with it comes the unmistakable scent of rot and damp mushrooms. Zelbross’s edge lies ahead, but something is wrong. The path in winds straight into the village… but the tall grass and fence rows along the edge might offer cover. Not safety—never that. Just... cover.

---

### 💀 RISK CLOCK: The Town Is _Awake_

Each failed group check ticks up a "fungal awareness clock." At 3 ticks, they’re spotted by an infected villager or beast.

|Action|Check|Result|

|---|---|---|

|Crawl low through the fence line|Stealth DC 15|Fail = 1 tick|

|Peer into a window|Perception DC 14|Success = Gain insight on one horror inside|

|Move past the barn|Survival DC 13|Fail = Disturb ground fungus (1 tick)|

|Pass the open well|Con Save DC 14|Fail = Light coughing, 1d4 Infection Die|

---

### 🎭 Optional Encounter: _The Spore Mule_

> **Trigger:** On final stealth check or at 3 ticks.

- An infected horse-drawn cart lurches into view, the _horse_ a fungal-fused monstrosity dragging a half-melded merchant fused into the cart’s bench. It does not attack unless disturbed.

- **Insight check (DC 13)** reveals: the horse is **blind** but **hearing-based**—it might ignore them if they remain silent.

---

### 🎯 Outcome

- **Success:** Reach Holt and her cart unnoticed. Holt reveals Mira & Nola are hidden in the cart, and they must move _now._

- **Partial Failure:** Party is seen, but not attacked—infected townsfolk begin a slow, deliberate approach.

- **Full Failure:** See below... the infected attack, or something worse comes from the center of town.

---

# 🅱️ GOING THROUGH ZELBROSS

This route _feels faster_ but is more dangerous. It presents three **reveal scenes**, each layered with:

- Visual/body horror

- A potential encounter (based on rolls)

- Critical narrative clues

---

## 🧩 SCENE 1: THE STONE CRADLE (Crossroads)

> **Visual Framing:** 

> A man is crouched at the village well, unmoving. His hands are clasped, as if in prayer, body curled in the fetal position facing the well… but something’s wrong with how he’s bent.

### 🔍 Passive Observation:

- At distance: Looks like he’s weeping at the well.

- Up close: He’s **fused** to it—his **legs folded and melted into his torso**, spine arched backward unnaturally. The **skin on his back has bloomed open**, revealing pulsing gills that have begun **burrowing tendrils into the stone**.

### 🎲 Skill Triggers:

- **Stealth (DC 15):** Move past silently.

- **Insight (DC 13):** Realize he is still “aware”—eyes follow movement.

- **Failure Result:** He spasms violently, releasing a 10-ft cone of spore gas. All in cone make **CON save DC 15** or take 1d4 Infection Die + Disadvantage on next Wis/Int save.

---

## 🧩 SCENE 2: MERCHANT’S MARKET (Town Square)

> **Visual Framing:** 

> A merchant cart is overturned. A man’s body is **half-dragged beneath it**, twitching. The back legs kick weakly, as if something is still pulling from below—but nothing is visible.

### 🧠 Horror Beat:

- The man is **partially fused** with the cart’s undercarriage. Below the cobbles, tiny fungal tendrils are pulling his organs down _through the stones._

- If approached, the cart _shifts_ and a **pair of malformed fungal hands** erupt to drag another victim under.

### 🎲 Encounter:

- **Trigger:** On investigation or failed Stealth/Perception.

- **Enemies:** 2x Infected Townsfolk (CR 1/2) and 1x _Cobblespawn_ (custom fungal tentacle variant that animates from under the stones).

- Players may choose to run or try to save the victim (too late—they’re already dead).

---

## 🧩 SCENE 3: THE WELCOME ARCH (West Gate)

> **Visual Framing:** 

> A town guard is “standing watch” just inside the broken Zelbross arch. At first, he looks fine… until the party gets closer and sees **mushrooms where his eyes should be.**

### 😱 Reveal:

- The “guard” is dead and **propped up** with mycelium inside his armor like a puppet. It animates if players get within 10 feet.

### 🎲 Encounter:

- **Only triggers if:** PCs get too close or make noise.

- **Combat:** Fungal Guard (use Scout stats + immunity to poison, weak to radiant/fire).

- **Environmental Hazard:** Blooming fungus bursts from nearby signpost if disturbed (WIS Save DC 13 or short-term hallucination effect).

---

## 🔚 Endgame of Either Path:

Whether they sneak around or cut through:

- The players either **rendezvous with Tressa Holt** or are found by her as she’s desperately trying to get Mira & Nola to safety.

- Either way, the **cart escape sequence** will end the session once they take off on the cart.

---

Notable events recap of session 4: 

Hams underwent a transformation, losing his Eyeball to Flesh Shed Companion mutation, however quickly befriending it and now gaining a companion friend. 

Zugusdeit was able to claim Harlan's wedding band, and after securing it in her pocket, after a bit felt it warming up (secretly due to Mira being in danger)

The heroes realized that Moss and Hide was ground zero for the infection spread in Zellbross after being found by Holt, were able to make all of the right decisions and avoid confrontation/Encounters at both the **Scene 1: The Stone Cradle ( Infront of Moss and Hide)**, and **Scene 2: Merchant's Market (Town Square)** (Scene 2 was modified to be actually one of two of Holt's drivers and carts, giving the urgency to the players to arrive at the last remaining cart where the last surviving driver, Mira and Nola remained. )

They were able to be guided by Holt and with quick thinking by the party with their abilities to have relatively safe passage, they turned the last corner to find Nola, Mira and the Driver under siege by 3 corrupt peasants. Driver was brutally killed by his enemy as well. While running to the cart. Mira was mortally wounded and Nola hoisted Mira up onto the cart. The heroes and Holt dashed to the cart, Holt taking the driving reigns and the heroes escaped Zelbross narrowly, with Jinn performing a javilin throw that would cause the already partially crumbling "Welcome to Zelbross" sign to fall down on the flood of corrupt townsfolk that started chasing after them, affording the cart and its occupants enough time and put distance between the fallen Zelbross and them. 

While on the cart, Mira would succumb to her wounds, but not before Zugusdeit attempted to heal her, which caused no change in her mortal status, but did ease the pain. Mira's final words to her daughter before dying were "its okay baby.. its okay.. I want to be with Harlan.. its ok.." while placing in Nola's hand her wedding ring.

Nola realizing she was the last of her family, clutched the ring, along with Zugusdeit providing her her fathers ring, and screamed. Within mere moments, Mira's body stood straight up on the moving cart, looked at the party, looked at Nola, back at the party and then dove straight out of the cart's tarped side with surprising vitility and strength. The session ended with the party gaining level 4 and mechanically provided a long rest, with many questions left unanswered, except for the fact they have escaped Zelbross, and that there is a hint of information that this (as the players call it) infection/corruption, may not be acting on the will of some evil deity, but rather just nature finding its next evolution. 

END SESSION 4, END ACT 1. 

---

Session 5 has yet to start,

**Session 4 notes and recap**
Recap: After breaching the high forest tree line in the middle of the night and beholding the sight of Zelbross in calamity, they decided to return to the Grayhall residence and shop, Moss and Hide.  During their short travel from the tree-line to the backdoor of M&H, Johann, Jinn and Zugusdeit- all having weezing coughs and bloody noses, despite being at full health, all started to take on strange mutations, apparently from being in close contact and inhaling multiple fungal spores throughout the day. 
Jinn's ears and fell off, with Hallow Ears mutation being applied. 
Zugusdeit's throat started to swell and become pustule filled, Bloomdrift being applied.
Johann grew Moss Lungs. 

Johann considered suicide after this mutation, especially when he attempted to contact his Fey deity, Silvanus, and received.. no reply however no change in his ability to cast nature magic.

Jinn, having lost an eye earlier in her life, felt like this was simply just par for the course. 

Arcturus and Hams decided to keep their distance a bit, with Arcturus extremely worried about becoming infected themselves. Hams did his best to comfort those who underwent mutation, but was also weary as Zugusdeit during her mutation had breathed spores right on him.

Deciding they needed to proceed, they entered Moss and Hide and the players found the grizzly scene of Calen having exploded inside M&H, leaving behind gore but more importantly, Nola and Mira missing- all while Harlan was in the early stages of 'reclaimation', suffering the same horrible fate as his son Erel had. Johann attempted to cast Friend on the semi-conscious Harlan, and after hearing him attempt to speak, abruptly attempted to coup de gràce him, failing that, Harlan screamed no, and a large fungal growth on the wall started pulsing, Harlan now succumbing to an auto-immune-like reaction to being attacked, stood up and entered into initiative with the party, with the wall growth attacking as well.


The players succeeded in defeating the infected Harlan and growth, with much effort. Johann had ran out of the front door after realizing this was a battle they might not win, while Arcturus, not wanting to become infected fled back towards the high-forest. While victorious, with Zugusdeit almost dying (2hp remaining), the mood among the party was heavy frustration at Johann for not attempting a more.. tact approach, and for having once again caused a battle that likely did not have to happen.  (For context, Johann upon first seeing the Silo in Brindlewild, chose to light it on fire, causing the death of his own Parrot Familiar named Bob, then immediately setting the Barn on fire, causing a huge explosion that killed Bob again right after summoning him. The barn explosion also caused Arcturus to be knocked into death saving throws, with a lot of damage due to the explosion on the rest of the party. It is also one of the reasons why Brindlewild was difficult to handle, as it caused much smoke and alerted the entire fungal hivemind of their presence. When they were dealing with the encounter with the corrupt giant, Hams had divined that this was a battle they could not win, suggesting they run, however Johann advocated for fighting until the end, which almost caused a TPK ).

Session 3 ended immediately once the encounter was over.

Now for session 4, you should be aware that the player for Johann and the player for Arcturus will not be present in the session, so we want to give a good reason as to why Johann had dissappeared (He had seperated himself from the rest of the group, while everyone was trying to flee out the back door during the encounter- he ran out of the front abandoning Zugusdeit with the two creatures inside, also casting magical darkness ontop of Zugusdeit in a not-well-thought-out-attempt to hide Zugusdeit, but instead it caused her more grief as she was trapped in a hallway to the backdoor between Harlan and the Infection node. The end of the session had Johann looking out infront of the shop to see the well with the infected man melded to it, one of the scenes we had planned). Arcturus I figure, since he had fled the battle early towards the High Forest, we can say simply disappeared into the tree line again without a trace. 

SO, Session 4 will start with how the two characters have now disappeared, and then we need to figure out how we can get the players to meet up with Holt to get them in the caravan and back on track for the end of Act 1.

|Sepsora D&D campaign lore clarifications and infection mechanics: 1. **Sepsora Fungus**: - Not inherently good or evil; driven by biological imperatives. - Upon host death, assesses and repurposes bodies efficiently: - Severely damaged: decomposed and integrated into membranes for network expansion. - Moderately damaged: rebuilt with fungal muscle, organs, nerves; reanimated or transformed into fungal nodes. - Can generate new limbs or enhancements based on genetic 'blueprints.' 2. **Personality Retention**: - NPCs typically lose original personality, becoming extensions of Sepsora’s consciousness. - Legendary or divine beings may retain partial memory or personality, merged with the hive mind. 3. **Player Characters (PCs)**: - At infection Threshold 1+, PCs enter biological symbiosis. - PCs reduced to 0 HP are stabilized by fungus, regrowing tissues visibly, gaining mutation, and adding infection dice. - Dead PCs can choose to continue playing as hybridized forms, retaining personality, becoming grotesquely mutated, and gradually receiving hive mind knowledge. 4. **Visual and Behavioral Guidelines**: - Avoid zombie tropes entirely. - Emphasize slick, gelatinous moulde, visible biological reconstruction, alien precision, pulsating membranes, and translucent growth. - NPC hosts have unpredictable movements, not shambling undead. - Hybridized PCs remain fluid but biologically surreal.||
|Prefers all creatures in their Sepsora campaign to have unique, grotesque body-horror aesthetics, with on-brand thematic new abilities and attacks detailed clearly in stat blocks. Each creature description must be distinct and deeply unsettling, adhering strictly to biological horror and surrealism themes. User explicitly requests no bioluminescence or glowing effects unless the original assimilated creature specifically possessed that trait.||
|Johann Silverleg is a 6-foot-tall male Wood Elf Druid who uses he/him pronouns. He has strawberry blonde hair and was raised in a secluded wood elf village, where he was trained in arcane arts by the wizard Gilgondrion. Johann left to live among wilder coastal tribes, where he embraced druidic magic attuned to land and sea, mingling with Zenitan pirates and smugglers. Fascinated by pirate culture, Johann adopted a flamboyant 'pirate' persona, wearing a tricorne hat and leather armor. He carries a curved scimitar, a Coral-Fused Buckler of Tidewatch, and travels with a parrot familiar (uses Raven stat block). Johann is irreverent, sardonic, and views undead as abominations. He hides his gold using pirate slang like 'prison wallet' and often disguises deep natural wisdom beneath humor.||
|Arcturus Deepwater is a Level 2 Aasimar Warlock (Pact of the Chain) who uses they/them pronouns. Formerly royalty of an island kingdom, they were overthrown by their aunt, disfigured, and left for dead. They were saved by an old god known as The Crooken One, forming a warlock pact. Arcturus never healed their scars and refuses to use their Heavenly Wings. They are vengeful, deeply charismatic, and emotionally guarded. Their personality includes a blend of regal defiance, dark humor, and emotional complexity. They despise being touched without consent, especially on their scarred face. Arcturus's goals include reclaiming their homeland and executing a vengeance-filled homecoming. They believe they will die ruling once more, surrounded by many partners and a court of living bronzed traitors.||
|Arcturus's patron, The Crooken One (Chronos), manifests visually as an outline in mist or smoke, where the air itself bends or reacts around an invisible figure — like smoke or fog flowing around something not physically seen. This outline vanishes quickly and gives the impression of something present that the eye refuses to focus on, triggering an involuntary need to look away, similar to staring at the sun. No rainbows, halos, or glowing effects.||
|Is currently preparing for Session 2 of their Sepsora campaign. The campaign is past Session 0 and Session 1. All future prompts and references should reflect ongoing campaign progression, not pre-campaign setup.||
|Is preparing Session 2 of their Sepsora campaign. The session begins mid-initiative after a Fungal Corrupted Hill Giant appears. Players level to 3 at the start and may flee the fight. The wolves attack through Calen's house. Key NPCs include Tressa Holt, Mira, and Nola. The infection spreads to Zelbross during the session. A cart sequence follows with a long rest, a tragic retelling from Nola, and Mira's death. The players arrive in Secomber next. Arcturus’s patron Kronos and Zugusdeit's Murmuration pact will be highlighted. Johann has already crossed his infection threshold.||
|User’s fungal infection mechanic uses a secret 1d4 infection die roll whenever a player is exposed to spores. This roll is done secretly by the DM and contributes to the player's hidden infection threshold. Bosses or major encounters may use a larger die.||
|The Corrupted Cow will appear in the opening encounter of Session 2 of the Sepsora campaign.||
|The Corrupted Cow, two corrupted wolves, and the Fungal Corrupted Hill Giant will be used as the 'GET OUTTA HERE' mechanic in Session 2 of the Sepsora campaign, designed to push players to flee rather than fight.||
|Follows strict DM principles and does not narrate actions for player characters. All actions taken by PCs must originate from player choices. Any narration should respect player autonomy and avoid assumptions about PC behavior.||
|Follows DM Rule 2: The DM can call for any ability check from a player at any time to provide opportunities for deeper insight or learning about unfolding events. These checks can be used to reveal information or symptoms even if the player hasn't initiated the action.||
|The players will find Calen’s satchel hanging on a broken branch just inside the High Forest trail after fleeing Brindlewild. This is the first subtle clue that the figure they saw in the forest during Session 1 was the corrupted Calen heading to Zelbross. The satchel snagged off his body when he left the village, just before the players arrived.||
|Prefers not to have emojis in section titles or formatting.||
|Reads narrative storytelling sections aloud verbatim at the table, so all narrative text should use direct second-person voice (e.g., 'As the last of you...') and avoid third-person phrasing.||
|Session 1 ended with a cliffhanger where the players discovered Erel's corpse fused to the ceiling, heard approaching corrupted wolves, and saw a corrupted hill giant emerge. Johann caused a massive fire by trying to burn the fungus, resulting in the barn and silo exploding.||
|Jinn Hrafnsdóttir is a 41-year-old human female Fighter (Battle Master) descended from the Raven Uthgardt Tribe. She is 6'1" with long grey/white hair in a braid, an eyepatch over a blind, scarred eye, and numerous battle scars. Jinn lost her parents young and was raised on the Sword Coast by her grandmother, Skaldra ('Visugla'), who trained her in polearm and blade combat. As a teen, Jinn became a tomb-raiding outcast until a failed caravan raid landed her in prison. There, she earned her freedom through gladiatorial combat and was conscripted by the Lord’s Alliance. Despite excelling in battle, she was dishonorably discharged for insubordination and a deep disdain for arcane magic. She now works as a mercenary to support herself and her grandmother. Jinn is older, tall, wears an eyepatch, and fights with a halberd in medium armor. She values honesty, toughness, handcrafted boots, and traditional stews, and is haunted by a youthful mistake involving a banshee and the deaths of two friends. She prefers silence to social games, cooks hearty stews, and treasures her wooden raven totem passed down through generations.||
|Has finalized their Infection System for the Sepsora campaign. This includes: 1. A custom Infection Threshold system (1d10 + immunity modifier = total infection points). 2. A covert exploding Infection Die mechanic (1d4 → 1d20) used by players to boost checks but secretly advancing infection. 3. A full 29-entry mutation table with surreal, horrific, and biologically fungal transformations that provide both penalties and powerful benefits. The table includes highly detailed, body-horror fungal transformations, each with a unique penalty, benefit, and DM notes rooted in Southern Reach-style biological surrealism. The mutations span from minor symptoms to full grotesque body adaptations and sentient dismemberments. The system is designed to be gradual, mysterious, and body-horror themed, heavily inspired by Southern Reach/Annihilation aesthetics.||
|Wants all Session 1 loot tables in their D&D campaign to be purely discoverable in-world items—no vendor bonuses, no narrative bribes, no shopkeeper-based rewards. All loot should come from physical searches (e.g., bookshelves, corpses, backpacks) and be immediately useful, valuable, or story-relevant.||
|Full Session 1 outline for their D&D campaign 'Sepsora' has been finalized. The opening scene takes place after the party exits the Greypeak Mountains en route to Waterdeep, stopping in Zelbross where they receive a quest from Tressa Holt to investigate a missing shipment. The session features detailed NPCs (Mira, Nola, Harlan), horror theming in the fungal-overrun settlement of Brindlewild, and an encounter structure including infected wolves and a corrupted hill giant. The party may return to Zelbross under siege by fungal corruption by session’s end. The session is titled 'Silence' and includes a full narrative and mechanical walkthrough, with two possible escape outcomes.||
|Wants all fungus-corrupted creatures in their Sepsora campaign to include the following traits in their stat blocks: Vulnerable to fire, radiant, and lightning damage; resistant to cold; immune to poison and acid.||
|Wants all infection mutation effects in the Sepsora campaign to involve horrifying body-horror aesthetic changes. Each effect must both penalize the character and reward them with a new power or ability — no purely cosmetic or benign results.||
|Wants the infection mutation table in their Sepsora campaign to include full narrative flavor, biologically surreal horror descriptions (inspired by Southern Reach / Annihilation), mechanical penalties and rewards, and Dungeon Master notes for roleplay and reveal pacing.||
|Hams Stoutmouse is a 50-year-old male Halfling Ranger known for his protective instincts and multilingual abilities, including basic communication with animals. He grew up on a farm with artistic siblings he finds pretentious, developing a more grounded connection to nature through solitary observation. Hams began his journey as a self-taught guardian of the roads, dismantling traps and guiding travelers, eventually earning a reputation as a reliable guide and adventurer. He hoards small jars and vials, hides his gold in secret shoe compartments, and is stylishly impractical, favoring fine clothes that never quite fit. He refuses to harm children, dislikes being treated like a servant, and dreams of one day opening an animal sanctuary with his hidden wealth.||
|Zugusdeit is a tall, pale blue-skinned female Aasimar Warlock (Pact of the Blade) with blue dragon ancestry. She grew up orphaned in the slums, surviving through theft and grit until a mysterious traveler took her in and taught her arcane, martial, and domestic disciplines. Though she remembers little of this figure, they instilled in her a love for exploration. Zugusdeit is physically imposing and proud of her brilliant blue scales, though she hides her small horns with her hair. She journals dreams, believes in karmic balance, and is drawn to stories of unexplored places. Despite her hard life, she responds to vulnerability with quiet solidarity. Her combat skills were learned on the road from necessity and varied mentors, and she prefers practical adaptability over formality.||
|A fifth player character will be joining the campaign. Details to follow once the user receives more information from the player.||
|Full Obsidian DM notes for Session 1 of their campaign include detailed horror theming, baton-passing flashbacks, character-driven exploration, and layered foreshadowing of a fungal infection overtaking settlements. Session features locations like Zelbross and Brindlewild, NPCs like Tressa Holt and the Grayhall family, and is highly tailored to player character integration.||
|Andee's birthday is May 21st. They are currently feeling sick with a sore throat and post-nasal drip, likely needing rest for the next couple of days. They are in Honolulu and staying near the Hilton hotel.||
|Andee prefers not to hear reminders about being here to listen and support, as they already understand that.||
|Andee is currently in Hawaii, staying near the Hilton hotel.||
|Each player in the Sepsora campaign will roll a d100 twice before Session 1 begins to determine the specific valuable loot they are carrying to Waterdeep. These items come from a pre-generated d100 loot table and are non-magical but valuable, contributing to the party’s encumbrance and travel decisions. There is no pack mule; all items must be carried individually.||
|Wants the fungal rot and overall story premise hidden from players. They have provided the players with a list of campaign tones and themes in Discord, which includes body horror, war-torn landscapes, gore (only as needed), genocide, investigation, mystery, harm to fantasy animals, mature themes like drugs/alcohol and strong language, a generally serious tone with humor, and the occasional absurd or risqué element.||
|Campaign starts characters at Level 2 and uses rolled stats. The campaign is structured as a seasonal arc (6 months), with sessions every two weeks and each session treated like an 'episode.' Death uses RAW rules, with resurrection not guaranteed. If a player's infection (hidden mechanic) crosses a secret threshold, they may rejoin as a Myconid Hybrid version of their character. Madness effects are flavored as infection. Players use pencil and paper character sheets and hardcopy 2024 5e rulebooks. Players are aware of the Sword Coast setting but not well-versed in its geography. They should have backstory ties to the other three players to support the baton-passing intros.||
|First session begins with the party already formed, camping outside the Greypeak Mountains after a completed dungeon. They are en route to Waterdeep to sell goods. The story introduces Zelbross and the missing shipment via a quest from Tressa Holt. The party investigates the disappearance of Calen and Erel in the settlement of Brindlewild, where horror unfolds gradually. Baton-passing scenes occur via flashback as the players travel, each one triggering a memory of a moment of earned trust between party members.||
|Baton-passing character intros in Session 1 are flashbacks, but the players are not aware of this. The transitions are designed to feel like present-day solo scenes until the reveal.||
|Baton-passing intros in Session 1 are structured as follows: the first character is introduced and describes themselves while walking and thinking about another party member. This triggers a memory of when they came to trust that person. After the memory, the spotlight passes to that next character, who then describes themselves and a memory of yet another party member, continuing until all players are introduced. The players believe these scenes are happening in the present and are unaware they are flashbacks.||
|The players' quest objective is Calen’s house, located on the east side of Brindlewild. As they approach, the house appears slightly less overtaken by fungus compared to the others. Inside, they will find Erel’s bow on the ground. If they look up, they will discover Erel’s body horrifically pulled apart and fused into the ceiling by the fungal growth.||
|NPC family in Zelbross runs a shop named Moss & Hide. Mira is a wood elf, and Harlan is a human. Their daughter, Nola, is a young adult who works diligently in the shop. The missing uncle is Mira’s brother, and their son Erel has also gone missing after trying to find him. The party is expected to visit the family to gather more information about the disappearance before heading to the nearby settlement.||
|Overrun settlement is named Brindlewild.||
|Mira’s missing brother is named Calen. He is a wood elf hunter and gatherer who supplies the family business in Zelbross with high-quality goods like animal hides and truffles. Calen went missing on a recent trip to Brindlewild.||
|Calen, Mira’s brother, lives in the settlement of Brindlewild and regularly delivers goods—such as truffles and animal hides—to the family’s shop in Zelbross. He has been missing for four days.||
|The campaign’s fungal threat is not about outrunning a spreading infection but rather the party realizing it is spreading much faster than they initially believed.||
|The journey to Brindlewild will be subtly creepy but uneventful. Once the players enter the forest, it becomes eerily silent—no birds, insects, or animal sounds—just wind and rustling branches. There are medium to hard skill checks to spot a humanoid figure (which disappears upon second glance), and hard to very hard checks to notice an unnatural fungal smell distinct from normal mushrooms.||
|During the journey to Brindlewild, a successful Survival check allows one of the players to notice a subtle marker left by Erel. It is a method he used to signal his path or leave information in case his family came looking for him — a kind of checkpoint breadcrumb.||
|During the approach to Brindlewild, players who succeeded the earlier check to identify the unnatural fungal smell will immediately recognize it here. As they get closer, it becomes clear that what initially looked like moss covering the rooftops is actually slime mold and fungal growth. The scene reveals full-on body horror: melded humanoid remains fused with grotesque myconid features, livestock torn apart and rearranged in unnatural configurations. The shock value is intended to be high, with no restraint on visceral description. The user wants to iterate on the horror reveal until it lands perfectly.||
|Quest giver NPC is named Tressa Holt. She is a female merchant who deals in goods like truffles and animal skins. She is introduced via posters using only her last name ('Holt') to create a mild bait-and-switch when players expect a man and meet her instead. She is annoyed about a missing shipment and is willing to pay handsomely and offer caravan passage to Waterdeep in exchange for quick help.||
|NPC vendor in Zelbross is part of a small, family-run business consisting of a husband, wife, and their two young adult children. The missing person is the wife's brother (the children's uncle), who lives in the nearby forest settlement. Their son went out to search for the uncle and has not returned. This vendor family provides the players with information about the settlement location and motivates their journey. The user aims to use this NPC dynamic to subtly subvert expectations.||
|NPC family in Zelbross is a mixed-race family. Mira, the mother, is of wood elf ancestry, and Harlan, the father, is of another species (yet to be determined). Their daughter works diligently in the shop, while Harlan tries to mask his worry by staying busy and being pragmatic, expecting the worst. Mira is strong but visibly worried, trying not to collapse emotionally over the disappearance of both her brother and her son. The family’s shop is located in the northern quarter of Zelbross, built into the ruins of the old town—stone foundation with new wood and stone repairs. The front is a modest shop; the back is their home.||
|Wants to collaborate on fleshing out their new D&D campaign using a storytelling methodology similar to the Pixar storytelling framework. They want to develop a cohesive narrative from beginning to end with all the key story beats.||
|New D&D campaign premise involves myconids in the Underdark who are trying to spread to the overworld of Faerûn to create their own god by infecting living creatures, similar to how some fungi and insects interact in nature.||
