## Current Snapshot (update before each prep) #current #snapshot
- **In one sentence:** The party has reached the lever-controlled vault door/elevator route toward the Governor’s Mansion level, and a new fight is breaking out immediately after the accidental death of the Drow laborer they helped.
- **Exact location:** Secomber prison expansion tunnels → vault door / elevator shaft route upward.
- **What just happened (last beat):** Lever puzzle, near-cave-ins, door opens; chaos; Drow laborer bolts and is killed by a thrown dagger.
- **Immediate stakes (next 10 minutes):** Survive the converging hostile forces, decide whether to press upward or retreat, and prevent getting trapped/drowned/collapsed.
- **Act status:** Act 2 finale in motion → Act 3 hook loaded.

## Table-Usable Plan (Session 8) #prep #next_session
> Source details live in: [[07. Sessions/2. Act Two/0.2.4 Session 8 - Downside Up]]

### Opening (10–15 min) — Zugusdeit Focus
- Use: [[04. Items/Murmuration (DM Reference)|Murmuration (DM Reference)]]
- Goal: Explain Zug’s “muted/absent” beats + demonstrate Murmuration’s control without stealing player agency.

### Core Beats (keep modular)
- 2–3 encounters while climbing toward / inside the mansion level.
- Confront: [[02. Characters/NPC/Governor Richard Der'ier]] (moral/political pivot).
- Escape: Secomber in collapse (physical and/or civic).
- Hook: Druid circle direction + Nola/Mira collision (Act 3 runway).

### Clues you must deliver (minimum 3)
- What Sepsora is building *for* (infrastructure = intent).
- What the Governor authorized (tunnels/labor/arrests) and what he knows vs denies.
- What the “next step” is (druid circle / siege visions / portals thread).

### End Scene Target
- Act 2 feels “resolved enough”… then the Act 3 stinger lands hard.
