- Great quote from Mordenkainen about the Abyss (Plane). Could be spun to be something ominous otherwise.

"Some scholars number and name the parts of the Abyss, declaring that this demon lord or that rules a portion of the place. When your house is on fire, does it matter what the flames look like in each room? Should you bother to give them names? What's important is escaping and putting out any fire that clings to you.”

- **Blast Femur**:  Leg explodes outwards in a cone with bone shrapnel and acid and poison aoe (2 round duration). One use per long rest. Movement speed drop by 10 upon use, disadvantage on acrobatics and athletics after use. 
	-  Aesthetic effect is a large slice like split down the side of the leg, half filled cluster boils surrounding the sliced tissue. The slice looks like a knife cut it length wise from hip to ankle, complete with open slice wound that looks like its festering around the edges. The slice is held together with a thin, transparent, mucus like membrane. The muscle looks atrophied and bone is exposed, pin-holes in the bone show bits of marrow.
