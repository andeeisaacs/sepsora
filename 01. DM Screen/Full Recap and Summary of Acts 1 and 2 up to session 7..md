## 1. Campaign Timeline – Act 1 & Act 2

---

### Act 1 – Brindlewild & Zelbross (Sessions 1–4)

_All in one brutal in-game day, from morning camp to late-night flight._

---

#### Session 1 – **Silence**

**Locations:** Road near Greypeak foothills → Town of Zelbross → Moss & Hide (Grayhall shop) → Secret Grayhall trail → High Forest → On the road toward Brindlewild

- The party wakes at a roadside camp along a well-traveled pass favored by merchants and bandits, bound generally westward.
    
- They arrive in **Zelbross** and are drawn to **Moss & Hide**, a combined tannery / workshop / home run by the **Grayhall family**:
    
    - **Mira** and **Harlan Grayhall** (parents),
        
    - **Nola** (daughter),
        
    - Mentions of **Calen** (Mira’s hunter brother in **Brindlewild**),
        
    - **Erel** (Mira & Harlan’s son).
        
- They learn:
    
    - Calen is **four days overdue** delivering a shipment and message arranged with merchant **Tressa Holt**.
        
    - Erel left **three days ago** to check on Calen in Brindlewild and never returned.
        
- **Tressa Holt** arrives and offers a deal:
    
    - **600 gp + passage west** if the party goes to **Brindlewild** via the High Forest, finds Calen/Erel, and returns with either them or answers.
        
- **Mira** shows them the **Grayhall back route**:
    
    - Through Moss & Hide’s backyard, along a hidden family path into the **High Forest**, marked subtly by Grayhall sign lore.
        
- The party leaves Zelbross the same day, entering the forest.
    
- **Johann** is already in “burn it out” mode:
    
    - He treats the strange growths as an affront to **Silvanus**, leaning toward fire as his default response.
        
    - Canonically, once he begins breathing Sepsora spores in this phase of the journey, **Silvanus silently cuts contact**—his prayers go unanswered, even though he still wields the druidic magic already granted.
        

---

#### Session 2 – **Night Harvest**

**Locations:** High Forest → Outskirts & interior of Brindlewild → Ruined barn & silo area → Calen’s house → High Forest (return path)

- Following the Grayhall trail deeper into the High Forest, the party notices:
    
    - Unnatural **silence**—no birdsong, no typical forest life.
        
    - Occasional strange spoor, animal sign, and eerie stillness.
        
- They reach **Brindlewild** near or after sunset and find:
    
    - Parts of the village overrun by **fungal membranes**, pulsing growths, and assimilated villagers.
        
- At a **barn** containing an assimilated woman:
    
    - Johann spots fungal corruption and, seeing it as a blasphemy to nature, responds with **fire**.
        
    - He **blows up the barn**, hurting the party, exploding his parrot familiar **Bob**, and attracting unwanted attention.
        
    - Later, after resummoning Bob via magic, Johann again sets off a blast (silo), killing the familiar a second time and knocking **Arcturus** into death saves.
        
    - These explosions are what **first draw the corrupted hill giant and wolves** toward Brindlewild.
        
- Inside **Calen’s home**, only **Hams** is small and nimble enough to squeeze through the fungus-crusted door:
    
    - The interior is thick with late-stage fungal overgrowth; this strongly feels like ground zero for Brindlewild.
        
    - Hams finds **Erel Grayhall**:
        
        - Body cut into **equal pieces**, each strung to a different ceiling corner by fungal strands.
            
        - Chest and back opened; his heart visibly beating, lungs working.
            
        - Eyes still tracking movement with unsettling precision.
            
    - Directly below Erel, Hams recovers **Erel’s bow**, half-fused to the floor, prying it from fungal crust.
        
    - The party deduces:
        
        - Erel is **still alive but fully assimilated**.
            
        - Healing magic wouldn’t “see” anything to fix—this is repurposing, not injury.
            
- Outside and around town, they encounter:
    
    - Small vignettes showing that **assimilated people aren’t truly dead**—they’re being used.
        
    - The idea that the infection is **systemic and organized**, not random.
        

---

#### Session 2 (cont.) – **Ashes & Fog / The Hill Giant Fight**

**Location:** Brindlewild outskirts

- As night fully settles, the real threat arrives:
    
    - A **corrupted hill giant**, accompanied by warped **wolves** and a twisted **cow**.
        
- **Time Freeze – Arcturus & The Crooked One:**
    
    - In the height of danger, time **freezes for everyone except Arcturus**.
        
    - Arcturus meets **Kronos, The Crooked One**:
        
        - Kronos chastises Arcturus and warns that letting Johann’s recklessness dictate everyone’s fate violates their pact.
            
        - He shows brief glimpses of how the corruption pushes back against his control of time.
            
        - He reiterates: **Arcturus must survive and investigate** this corruption, or be consumed.
            
- Time resumes; a brutal multi-enemy fight plays out:
    
    - Mid-battle, the giant **body-slams Hams** into Calen’s overgrown home, collapsing it.
        
    - This impact **crushes what remains of Erel**, effectively killing him as collateral. No one chose it; he was structurally part of the growth.
        
- After the fight grinds on, the giant and its creatures **break away and march north**, as if called to another priority.
    
    - This is the first clear demonstration that whatever drives them **reprioritizes**, not randomly retreats.
        

---

#### Session 3 – **Return**

**Locations:** Ruined Brindlewild → High Forest Grayhall trail → Approach to Zelbross

- The party, battered, chooses not to linger in Brindlewild:
    
    - The village is too far gone and clearly part of something bigger.
        
- As they leave, the narration (and Kronos’ prior intervention) makes it clear:
    
    - The monsters leaving them alive is **not mercy**, it’s **resource optimization** by the overmind.
        
- On the return along the Grayhall trail:
    
    - The **“tall-for-a-halfling ranger”** Hams spots a **satchel** snagged near the path:
        
        - It’s **Calen’s satchel**.
            
        - Inside: survival supplies, and **Calen’s journal**.
            
    - Calen’s journal reveals:
        
        - Routine hunting details around Brindlewild.
            
        - Discovery of an **Underdark passage** and oddities in regional fauna.
            
        - Notes about **Day-walking, calm Drow in Lolth armor** locked up by nervous locals.
            
        - Increasingly worried entries about fleeing woodland creatures and strange fungal sightings.
            
        - The entries abruptly stop right before Calen was due to travel to Zelbross with Holt’s shipment.
            
- Near treeline, at night, they finally see **Zelbross** again:
    
    - Fires, chaos, people running.
        
    - The town is clearly experiencing the same internal collapse Brindlewild did—only faster.
        

---

#### Session 4 – **Moss & Hide / Zelbross Collapse**

**Locations:** High Forest edge → Moss & Hide backyard → Moss & Hide interior → Rear lane/streets of Zelbross → Holt’s cart → On the road away from Zelbross

- Rather than use the main roads, the party:
    
    - Follows the **Grayhall forest route** right to Moss & Hide’s **backyard**.
        
    - Approaches under an oppressive **midnight sky**, with the town clearly in crisis.
        
- **Moss & Hide Interior – Harlan & Membrane Node:**
    
    - Inside, **Johann** and **Zugusdeit** investigate while **Hams, Jinn, and Arcturus** remain outside in the yard.
        
    - They find:
        
        - Evidence that **Calen exploded** in the central shop space—this was ground zero for Zelbross’s infection.
            
        - **Harlan Grayhall** partially fused into the interior wall, stretched and reconfigured, still semi-sentient.
            
    - Johann, seeing this as an abomination, tries **Friends** on Harlan—unsurprisingly useless.
        
    - With what’s left of his face, Harlan speaks in garbled, backward pleas:
        
        - Emotionally, it’s clear he’s asking for release, worried about his family.
            
    - Johann attempts a “mercy kill” coup-de-grace **from inches away**—and fails badly.
        
        - The fungal system reacts as a **defense mechanism**:
            
            - Harlan’s body animates as a **Moulde-Strung Corpse**.
                
            - A nearby **Membrane Node** tears itself off the wall, becoming a scuttling, many-legged hazard.
                
    - Combat erupts:
        
        - Zug nearly dies (again), the party forced into desperate moves.
            
        - At one point, Johann decides to **run out the front** of the shop, then casts a **fog/cloud spell** inside:
            
            - It blinds Zugusdeit but has no effect on the fungus’ **blindsight**.
                
            - This significantly worsens Zug’s situation and further strains the party’s patience with Johann.
                
    - Outside, Hams, Jinn, and Arcturus help manage threats and positioning as best they can from the rear yard.
        
    - Ultimately, they **destroy Harlan’s mutated form and the Membrane Node**.
        
- **Fungal Reclamation & Harlan’s Ring:**
    
    - After the fight, outside in the backyard:
        
        - They witness **Harlan’s severed arm** being dragged away into the grass by fungal tendrils and vanishing into the dark.
            
        - Left behind in the disturbed soil is **Harlan’s bronze wedding band**, which they recover.
            
- **Johann & Arcturus disappear:**
    
    - During the chaos:
        
        - **Arcturus** appears to the party to **flee the scene**, overwhelmed, low on resources, and not wanting another fight.
            
            - In truth, Kronos **snatches Arcturus out of time** at this moment (just as he froze time in Brindlewild), pulling them into a future segment (the druid circle/siege visions that will be fully explored in Act 2).
                
        - **Johann** runs out the front of Moss & Hide.
            
            - Outside the shop, near the well, he is **grabbed and dragged down** by the fungal network:
                
                - This is tied to the “well-host” infrastructure creature glimpsed later.
                    
                - Sepsora pulls him into its underground channels as a **“Sovereign resource”**, relocating him to where it wants him next (Act 2’s Secomber).
                    
    - To the party, both Johann and Arcturus have **vanished during the Moss & Hide chaos**—one out the front, one into the night.
        
- **Holt’s arrival & regroup:**
    
    - After the fight, an injured **Tressa Holt** arrives at Moss & Hide:
        
        - Bandaged, shaken, but alive.
            
        - She reacts in horror to what remains of Harlan.
            
        - She explains:
            
            - **Mira and Nola** had come to her, half-panicked, after things started going wrong.
                
            - She left them as safe as she could manage near her **cart**, then came to check on Moss & Hide.
                
            - Zelbross is being overrun; they need to **leave quickly**.
                
- **Zelbross streets & escape:**
    
    - The remaining party + Holt move through parts of **Zelbross** to reach Holt’s cart:
        
        - They see hints of **infected Drow** among the corrupted townsfolk but do **not** fight or engage them.
            
        - Through skill checks and problem-solving, they **avoid most encounters**, weaving through burning streets and panicked survivors.
            
    - The only major combat is at the **cart**:
        
        - They find **Mira and Nola** defending Holt’s last surviving cart from a wave of infected.
            
        - The party helps finish off remaining threats and secures the cart.
            
    - During the escape:
        
        - Mira is **gravely wounded**.
            
        - On the road, after they finally get clear of Zelbross, she succumbs to her injuries, **dies**, then **reanimates under Sepsora’s control**.
            
        - In a horrifying moment, this reanimated Mira:
            
            - Stands, recognizes the opportunity,
                
            - And **launches herself off the moving cart** into the night, sprinting away with unnatural speed into the dark forest.
                
    - The session (and Act 1) ends with:
        
        - Zelbross burning behind them,
            
        - **Holt, Nola, and the remaining party** on the cart fleeing into the night toward **Secomber**,
            
        - Johann and Arcturus **missing**, each altered and relocated in their own ways.
            

---

### Act 2 – Secomber & The Prison (Sessions 5–8)

**Act 2 begins the next in-game day**, with the cart having traveled through the night away from Zelbross.

---

#### Session 5 – **No Rest for the Rest**

**Locations:** Holt’s cart (overnight) → Secomber eastern gate → Secomber streets → Tavern/inn

- The party finally gets a **long rest** on Holt’s cart after the Zelbross escape and levels to **4**.
    
- **What actually happened to Arcturus while “he fled”:**
    
    - When the group thinks Arcturus ran into the forest back at Moss & Hide, **Kronos actually yanked him out of the timeline**:
        
        - Similar to the time-freeze in Brindlewild, but more extreme.
            
        - Arcturus is dropped into a **future point in time** and lives through it:
            
            - A **druidic grove** overtaken by fungal membrane, druids frozen mid-ritual around a central grotesque figure.
                
            - Several **branching futures** where the party dies or is horrifically mangled depending on choices.
                
            - A massive **siege of a great city** (strongly implied to be **Waterdeep**) beneath a spore-darkened sky, with twisted creatures attacking the walls.
                
        - Kronos explains:
            
            - This siege is the **last moment he can see** in time; beyond it is obscured.
                
            - Even as the god of time, his sight stops there because **he himself dies or is consumed** in that branch of the timeline when Sepsora “wins.”
                
            - Arcturus must **be there** and **discover why** the future ends.
                
        - When Kronos is finished, he **drops Arcturus back into the present**, rejoining the party on Holt’s cart en route to Secomber.
            
- **Johann’s off-screen journey into Secomber:**
    
    - The sequence where Johann disappeared from Moss & Hide continues:
        
        - He is pulled into **cold, subterranean water**, begins to drown, then realizes he can breathe via a new structure under his chin—his **first Sepsora mutation**.
            
        - Suspended in a sticky web-like medium, he senses a many-voiced consciousness: **Sepsora**.
            
        - It evaluates him:
            
            - “Reallocate resource?”
                
            - “Sovereign drone.”
                
            - “Relocate to front… optimal positioning for other sovereigns.”
                
        - Sepsora **relocates** him through its network and spits him out near **Secomber** at dawn.
            
    - Guards find him soaked, mutated, and out of place:
        
        - “It’s one of those fuckin’ druids.”
            
        - “Oh what the fuck is that under his chin?”
            
        - They drag him into the **city prison**, lumping him in with captured druids and Drow.
            
    - Johann, who already saw Sepsora as worse than undead, hears these phrases clearly in his mind and knows Sepsora has **claimed him as a special asset**, deepening his revulsion and crisis of faith.
        
- **Other rest-phase beats:**
    
    - **Jinn** relives and warps family memories into Sepsora-flavored body horror (grandmother, kitchen, stew, her own body as the vessel).
        
    - **Hams** dreams of his days as a protective road-warden, which warp into visions of **Erel’s mangled remains**carrying faces of those he fears failing.
        
    - **Zugusdeit** manifests the **Lure Bloom** mutation and feels Murmuration’s whispered guidance sharpen; Murmuration is secretly jealous of Sepsora’s influence and will later be revealed as the fabricated “mentor” in her memories.
        
- **Arrival at Secomber:**
    
    - Holt’s cart reaches the **eastern gate** of **Secomber** at dawn.
        
    - Guards are on edge:
        
        - Rumors of **Zelbross burning**.
            
        - Reports of **Drow** and **druids** connected to disappearances.
            
        - Strange shimmering **clouds** sighted low on the horizon.
            
    - Holt leans on her reputation and offers to reduce local tabs to get the cart through.
        
    - Once inside, a guard questions why she only has **one cart**, pushing on what she’s carrying.
        
    - **Arcturus** sets a **fire distraction** (weapons rack + oil); in the chaos, Holt drives the cart deeper into Secomber.
        
- **Inside Secomber:**
    
    - The city is taut with fear:
        
        - **MISSING** posters all over.
            
        - Broad **“Wanted: Drow and Druids”** warnings.
            
        - Windows shutter as they pass.
            
    - Holt proposes:
        
        - Ditch the cart.
            
        - **Lay low**.
            
        - Don’t publicly associate with each other if it can be helped.
            
    - Holt and the party split:
        
        - Holt takes a corner table at a **local tavern/inn**, trying to keep a low profile.
            
        - Later we learn **Nola** has slipped away on a **solo hunch** to find her mother.
            
- **Tavern intel:**
    
    - The party goes into the same tavern to eat and gather information:
        
        - Two off-duty guards talk about a **soaking-wet druid** with a **tricorn hat** who appeared inside the walls and was thrown into the prison—Johann.
            
        - A bruised **Drow woman** confirms:
            
            - Secomber is rounding up **Drow and druids** indiscriminately.
                
            - Two **Lolth-armored Drow** with unnervingly cycling pupils have been imprisoned too.
                
    - They run into **Holt**:
        
        - She is frustrated they’re blowing her “we don’t know each other” cover.
            
        - She tells them **Nola ran off** to find Mira and hasn’t returned.
            
    - **Arcturus** uses **Mask of Many Faces** to disguise as a Secomber **guard**:
        
        - Confirms Johann is held in the **city prison**.
            
        - Organizes a plan: she’ll escort the others as if they’re new prisoners to get them down to the cells.
            

---

#### Session 6 – **Under Pressure**

**Location:** Secomber city prison – basement cell block

- **Entering the cell hall:**
    
    - Arcturus, disguised as a guard, leads the rest of the party into the **basement prison block**.
        
    - The party are **not actually jailed**; they are walking the corridor in chains as a ruse.
        
    - They see:
        
        - **Two Drow in full Lolth military armor**, strangely calm and docile in their cells.
            
        - Numerous **druids**, some with **red armbands** (Red Band), some without.
            
        - Many **ordinary Drow**, imprisoned purely out of racial paranoia.
            
- **Red Band druids clock them:**
    
    - Red-banded druids step up to the bars as the party passes, studying them.
        
    - They greet the group as **“Sepsora’s Sovereign”**, clearly recognizing their mutations and unique status.
        
    - They explain:
        
        - The infection’s name is **Sepsora**.
            
        - It is **nature’s next step**, not a disease.
            
        - The party are **Sovereign drones**—mutated, mobile agents, not destined for standard assimilation.
            
- **Ground-zero event:**
    
    - One Red Band druid notes that **“it’s about to happen”**.
        
    - The **Lolth-armored Drow** at the far end **detonate into spores**, becoming a new **ground-zero** inside the prison.
        
    - The explosion:
        
        - Kills and mutates guards and prisoners.
            
        - Fuses some into walls and floors as infrastructure.
            
        - Unleashes fresh fungal horrors.
            
- **Chaotic battle:**
    
    - The corridor becomes a three-way war:
        
        - **Red Band druids** embrace the spread and fight zealously.
            
        - **Secomber guards** and the **Veteran Jailor** struggle to contain the catastrophe.
            
        - Newly **mutated guards/prisoners** rampage under Sepsora’s influence.
            
    - The **Veteran Jailor** becomes corrupted mid-fight and is ultimately **killed by the party**.
        
- **Freeing Johann & fleeing downwards:**
    
    - During the chaos, the party:
        
        - Reaches **Johann’s cell**.
            
        - Frees him.
            
        - Recovers his **scimitar, shield, and tricorn hat**.
            
    - They have **no time to loot** anything else:
        
        - No guard gear, no hidden items; just Johann’s essentials.
            
    - With more threats and spores closing in, they:
        
        - Retreat into a side chamber with **stairs leading down**.
            
        - Slam and **barricade** the door behind them as enemies batter it.
            
    - The only route left is **down into the unfinished expansion**.

#### Session 7 – **Locked In**

**Location:** Prison expansion tunnels → elevator to Governor’s Mansion level

- **Descent into the expansion:**
    
    - The barricade shakes; staying above means death.
        
    - The party (Hams, Jinn, Johann, Arcturus, Zugusdeit) descends the stairs into the darkness.
        
    - They find:
        
        - Rough-hewn **half-finished corridors**.
            
        - Unused cells and workspaces.
            
        - Tools, carts, and debris scattered about.
            
        - Vermin scuttling through shadows.
            
    - This is the **prison expansion**, being dug by **forced labor** to house excess prisoners.
        
- **The Drow laborer:**
    
    - The party hears footsteps deeper in the dark.
        
    - After calling out and some cautious exchange, they corner an **escaped Drow prisoner**:
        
        - Press-ganged into expanding the prison tunnels.
            
        - Jailed for being Drow; now exploited as labor.
            
        - Took advantage of the outbreak upstairs to flee into the tunnels.
            
        - Wary of the armed, mutated party, but recognizes they’re also trying to survive.
            
    - He knows of **another way out** that does not require returning to the main prison block.
        
- **Lever puzzle & collapsing tunnels:**
    
    - They reach a **bank of levers** controlling heavy doors and security systems:
        
        - The correct sequence opens a **vault door** to an **elevator shaft** leading toward the **Governor’s Mansion**.
            
        - Incorrect sequences cause **partial cave-ins** and **water leaks**, threatening to trap or drown them.
            
    - After several tense attempts and near disasters:
        
        - They hit the correct combination.
            
        - The vault door opens.
            
        - The party and the Drow laborer scramble into the **elevator** and ride it up as the tunnel collapses behind them.
            
- **Elevator exit & tragedy:**
    
    - The elevator opens into a hallway connected to/under the **Governor’s Mansion**:
        
        - Smoke, shouting, running guards—Secomber is in crisis.
            
    - The **Drow laborer**, seeing brief chaos and an opening, panics and tries to **bolt for freedom**.
        
    - In the ensuing confusion and combat:
        
        - A **throwing dagger** meant for someone else hits him in the head.
            
        - He dies instantly, collapsing into the hall.
            
    - The party is confronted with the sudden death of a would-be escapee they just helped.
        
    - Hostile forces converge, and a new fight begins as the session ends.

#### Session 8 – **Downside Up** (Planned, Not Yet Played)

**Location (planned):** Governor’s Mansion & Secomber streets

> This session is prep only; nothing here has happened at the table yet.

- Planned opening focuses on **Zugusdeit and Murmuration**:
    
    - Explains why Zug was muted during parts of Session 7.
        
    - Reveals Murmuration’s depth of control and jealousy over Sepsora’s hold on her, and that her “mentor” was a fabricated construct all along.
        
- Planned encounters:
    
    - A **gauntlet** through or around the **Governor’s Mansion**, dealing with guards, chaos, and possibly early Sepsora spread.
        
    - A confrontation with **Governor Richard Der’ier** about:
        
        - Indiscriminate imprisonment of Drow and druids.
            
        - Forced labor in the expansion.
            
        - Responsibility for how badly the prison outbreak went.
            
- Planned outcomes:
    
    - The party must **escape Secomber**, which is sliding toward instability under fear and infection.
        
    - The path out leads them toward:
        
        - A **druid circle** Arcturus already saw in his future displacement.
            
        - A central mutated figure strongly implied to be **Mira**.
            
        - A major Act 2 climax when Nola, Mira, Sepsora, and the party collide.

## 2. Ongoing Threads & Hooks

---

### Sepsora & Its Agents

- **Sepsora (Fungal Overmind / Myconid Evolution)**
    
    - A hidden fungal intelligence growing beneath the world.
        
    - Not inherently malicious; seeks **ascension** and recognition as a sentient power.
        
    - Behaves as:
        
        - **Infrastructure builder** (Brindlewild, Moss & Hide, Zelbross, Secomber prison).
            
        - **Weapon engineer** (exploding Lolth Drow, Membrane Nodes).
            
        - **Strategic mind**, reprioritizing threats and resources.
            
    - **Sovereign drones (the PCs)**:
        
        - Mutated but not fully integrated.
            
        - Treated as mobile, autonomous agents.
            
        - Gain power (infection die, mutations) at the cost of drifting further into Sepsora’s influence.
            
    - Endstate is flexible:
        
        - Sepsora wants to become a new deity / acknowledged power.
            
        - If that requires total overwrite or peaceful coexistence, it is **indifferent**; the party’s choices (especially around planar gates later) will decide.
            
- **Red Band Druids**
    
    - Druids with **red armbands**.
        
    - Ideologically aligned with Sepsora as the “next step of nature.”
        
    - Recognize and name the party **“Sepsora’s Sovereign”**.
        
    - Orchestrate the Secomber prison outbreak via **Lolth Drow bombs**.
        
    - Content to die in spore-rich environments, trusting Sepsora’s will.
        
- **Other Druids & Drow**
    
    - **Non–Red Band druids**:
        
        - Also imprisoned in Secomber.
            
        - Some reject Red Band methods, but still swept up by fear-driven policies.
            
        - DM-side: a few survivors exist off-screen; the party doesn’t know who, if any, lived.
            
    - **Ordinary Drow**:
        
        - Imprisoned on appearance alone.
            
        - One forced into labor helps the party escape and dies accidentally.
            
        - Others may have escaped or died; status unknown to the party.
            
    - **Lolth-armored Drow**:
        
        - Used as docile delivery systems.
            
        - Detonate into spores to seed new nests (Zelbross, Secomber prison).
            

---

### Mortals & Institutions

- **Grayhall Family**
    
    - **Harlan** – assimilated in Moss & Hide; reanimated, fought, destroyed. Later repurposed as infrastructure.
        
    - **Mira** – dies during cart escape; reanimates under Sepsora and flees into the night.
        
    - **Nola** – survives, later runs off on her own hunch to find Mira; currently missing.
        
    - **Erel** – fully assimilated in Calen’s house; accidentally killed when the hill giant collapses the building.
        
    - Their story is deeply tied to Sepsora’s early evolution and to the party’s guilt.
        
- **Tressa Holt**
    
    - Veteran caravan leader and trader.
        
    - Hired the party, then became a co-survivor of Brindlewild & Zelbross.
        
    - Helped get them to Secomber.
        
    - Currently in Secomber, exhausted, laying low at the tavern; plans to rest and then seek Nola if she can.
        
- **Calen**
    
    - Mira’s hunter brother.
        
    - Patient zero in Brindlewild.
        
    - His **journal** provides early lore connecting:
        
        - Odd wildlife behavior,
            
        - Day-walking Drow,
            
        - Hidden Underdark routes.
            
- **Secomber Authorities**
    
    - **Governor Richard Der’ier**:
        
        - Ordered mass arrests of Drow and druids.
            
        - Authorized forced labor tunnel expansion.
            
        - Directly created the conditions for the prison disaster.
            
        - Set up as a moral and political pivot point in Session 8.
            
    - **Veteran Jailor**:
        
        - Loyal but part of the oppressive system.
            
        - Mutated and killed in the prison outbreak.
            
- **Kronos, The Crooked One**
    
    - A being of time itself; Arcturus’s patron.
        
    - Fascinated by Sepsora because it represents a **blind spot** in time:
        
        - In the “Sepsora wins” branch, Kronos is infected/dies, so he cannot see past his own end.
            
    - Uses Arcturus as an instrument to:
        
        - Investigate the cause of his temporal blindness.
            
        - Potentially influence the outcome.
            
- **Silvanus**
    
    - Johann’s god.
        
    - Once Johann became infected (breathing spores, mutations starting), **Silvanus cut off direct communication**.
        
    - Johann still has his magic (it can’t be un-granted), but his prayers are met with silence, fueling theological and personal crisis.
        
- **Murmuration**
    
    - Zugusdeit’s pact blade and secret “mentor.”
        
    - Jealous of Sepsora’s hold on Zug; would purge the infection if it could.
        
    - Altered Zug’s memories, fabricating the “mentor” figure and gaslighting her.
        
    - Provides whispered tactical guidance in battle, increasing Zug’s effectiveness and dependence.
        

---

### PC-Specific Threads

- **Johann Silverleg**
    
    - Views Sepsora as worse than undead; seriously contemplated killing himself upon realizing he was mutated.
        
    - Familiar **Bob** has already died twice in Brindlewild due to Johann’s impulsive fires and distance limits.
        
    - Now knows Sepsora labeled him **“Sovereign drone”** and relocated him.
        
    - Cut off from Silvanus emotionally, but still slinging nature magic.
        
    - Carries both guilt and anger, projected at Sepsora, himself, and the failings of gods.
        
- **Zugusdeit**
    
    - Aasimar with blue dragon ancestry; pact bound to Murmuration.
        
    - Bears **Lure Bloom** and later mutations, becoming an increasingly attractive target for Sepsora and Murmuration alike.
        
    - Believes she had a mentor; in truth, that mentor is a planted memory created by Murmuration.
        
    - Her body and agency are pulling points in a tug-of-war between:
        
        - Sepsora (fungal ascension),
            
        - Murmuration (jealous patron/weapon),
            
        - Her own celestial/dragon potential.
            
- **Hams Stoutmouse**
    
    - Road-warden ranger with a low-level reputation as a dependable guide.
        
    - Holds guilt over Erel and survivors he couldn’t protect.
        
    - Family farm is **already doomed** in your notes; surviving family will likely appear as **refugees** in Waterdeep.
        
    - Infection/mutations sit at odds with his desire to keep people safe, giving him powerful stakes in Sepsora’s trajectory.
        
- **Arcturus Deepwater**
    
    - Ex-paladin, now pactbound to Kronos; gave up his Heavenly Wings for a warlock pact.
        
    - Has been forcibly **time-displaced** to a future druid circle and a final siege point.
        
    - Must be present at the “last visible moment” to determine why the future ends.
        
    - His distant island kingdom is a potential **holdout against Sepsora**, and his revenge arc intersects with the larger infection narrative.
        
- **Jinn Hrafnsdóttir**
    
    - Earless, with fungal ear canals; already familiar with losing body parts in a practical, almost grimly humorous way.
        
    - Sees Sepsora as a **new category of horror**, not just an expansion of her undead/banshee trauma.
        
    - The idea of Sepsora reaching her **grandmother Visu** and the Raven Tribe is a nightmare scenario.
        
    - Visu and the tribe are primed to be a **late-campaign ally force**, possibly arriving at Waterdeep.

## 3. Continuity Notes & Open Ends

---

- **Arcturus’ “flight” during Moss & Hide** is canonically **time displacement by Kronos**, not cowardly retreat. The party only sees him vanish; DM canon is that he’s living future moments and then returned.
    
- **Johann’s disappearance** is a **physical relocation through Sepsora’s network**:
    
    - Dragged via fungal conduits.
        
    - Evaluated and tagged as a **Sovereign drone**.
        
    - Deposited near Secomber for later use.
        
- The party was **never formally imprisoned** in Secomber:
    
    - Arcturus’ disguise + escort ruse got them into the cell block.
        
    - They are in the hallway when Red Band druids speak to them.
        
- The **Veteran Jailor** they meet is mutated and killed. There is no alternate, surviving version of that specific NPC.
    
- The party **loots nothing** from the prison beyond Johann’s equipment due to the constant pressure and need to escape.
    
- **Holt and Nola**:
    
    - Holt is in Secomber, recovering and trying to remain unnoticed in the tavern, planning to go after Nola when she can.
        
    - Nola has gone off on her own to find Mira; her path and current state remain unknown.
        
- **Brindlewild, Zelbross, and Hams’ home region** are all on Sepsora’s infection map:
    
    - Brindlewild and Zelbross are lost.
        
    - Hams’ home is doomed offscreen; his family will likely emerge as refugees later.
        
- **Survivors from Secomber’s prison** (non–Red Band druids, non-Lolth Drow) exist off-screen but unnamed:
    
    - The party has no confirmation either way.
        
    - They can be used later as witnesses, allies, or complications.
        
- The **infection die**:
    
    - PCs now understand it ties directly to Sepsora’s gifts and their mutations.
        
    - Its thresholds and exact consequences remain unknown to them.
        
- **Endgame levers** are in place:
    
    - Kronos can’t see past a specific siege where he dies or is infected in the “Sepsora wins” branch.
        
    - Sepsora’s ascension may hinge on planar moves (Feywild / Shadowfell portals in Waterdeep).
        
    - PC choices will determine whether Sepsora becomes a recognized new power, is constrained, or is prevented from ascending at all.
