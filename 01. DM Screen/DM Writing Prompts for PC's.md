# 🎭 100 In-Character RP Warm-Up Prompts

> Use these prompts to explore your character’s mindset, history, quirks, trauma, and downtime habits.  Either go down the list one by one, or roll a d100 and answer the question(s) that match the number
> 
> **Important:** **==Answer in the words of your character==**, ***not as you the player***. These questions and your answers are for you and you alone. Journal these in secret, or use them as springboards for role play.  Do not share them with anyone other than the DM/GM if you are asked. 
> 
> These should help you get into the mind and motivations behind your character and allow you to make role playing choices based on continuity of answers.  
> 
> **Note:** Answer every question, even If a question does not have some-sort of actual applicability to your characters backstory or personality, answer it how your character would regardless.
> 
> **Example** **Question**: "Do you cook?"
> Perhaps your character never cooks, infact they never really even buy food for themselves.
> --- 
> **Example Answer 1**: "Nah, I just wait till John passes out and I grab one of 'is sweet rolls. Or I get 'em drunk and 'onvince em to buy me a meal. Works like-a charm" 
> 
> **Example Answer 2**: "As a vampire, I absolutely can *not* consume anything other than blood, and fresh blood at that, preferably directly from the source. Source to mouth. But I do wonder if those sweet rolls John always talks about are as delicious as he makes them out to be, considering the man spends his last coin on securing a large enough horde of them."
