### 🎲 Mutation 2 — "Lensbone"

**Mutation:** Your ribs subtly twist inward over the day, forming a circular hollow beneath the sternum. No pain, just an unsettling pull. Before you can recoil from the sight, a membrane forms across the circle — nearly invisible, and while exposed to air It crystallizes into something like fogged glass. You feel it looking back. 

**Penalty:** –1 Wisdom saving throws  

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, detect invisible/ethereal creatures within 60 ft. for 1 minute. 

**DM Note:** Don’t name this power. Let them discover the perception bonus by feeling a presence or seeing footprints appear where no one walks.

---

### 🎲 Mutation 3 — "Tongue Archive"

**Mutation:** The tongue dries, splits at the tip, and grows rigid ridges along the underside. When you speak, **you taste memory** — not your own. You can speak perfectly in voices you’ve never heard before. 

**Penalty:** –1 to Persuasion (your voice unsettles people, too precise, too exact)  

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, mimic any voice or sound you’ve heard this week (DC 15 Insight to detect falsehood) 

**DM Note:** Encourage eerie moments where the character slips into voices by accident. Especially ones they should not be able to mimic.

---

### 🎲 Mutation 4 — "Glass Nerves"

**Mutation:** The inner forearm skin becomes translucent. Beneath the translucent skin, your veins and musculature no longer resemble anything of your natural anatomy for your species. Fungal threads pulse faintly in crosshatched lattices, shimmering like oil-slick webs. They twitch prior to something happening in your vicinity, anticipating stimuli before you perceive them. 

**Penalty:** –1 to Deception and Persuasion  

**Benefit:** Advantage on Arcana and Investigation involving anomalies or infection 

**DM Note:** Let NPCs see this without comment at first, then show them becoming wary. This is a **social signal of danger.**

---
~~~~### 🎲 Hams Mutation 5 — **Split Stitch**

**Mutation:** A hairline seam appears down one limb — a tight, raised fold like a scar, slightly moist. When pulled, the skin peels cleanly away to reveal a limb wrapped in fibrous mycelium.  
**Penalty:** –1 to Acrobatics and Sleight of Hand  

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, you can dislocate and stretch this limb up to 15 ft for 1 minute. It acts like a flexible whip or climbing appendage.  

**DM Note:** This should feel like a choice — players must willingly manipulate the seam. It heals slowly, but with no pain.

---
### 🎲 Mutation 6 — "Shadowed Colony"

**Mutation:** The entire back of your character rashes, and develops splotchy shaped, flat wart like postules. Before anything can be done about it, they start emitting small short pops, oozing a clear scentless liquid tinted red by your blood. It starts from your scalp, down your neck, your shoulders, back, legs and heels- it feels like something trying to push out of your pores, something too large for them. After a cacophony of pops all at once, the feeling of pressure building gives way to the stinging sensation left in its wake. 

Your shadow is no longer yours. It lags, shifts unnaturally, sometimes detaching- it will move away to cling to walls, crawl forward without you, or mimic gestures you didn’t make or made moments ago. In daylight, it vanishes entirely. But in darkness or torchlight, it no longer flickers around, it shifts like a wave of water and with strange intelligence.

Whenever you have paused momentarily on dirt and your shadow remains still, it will leave behind an outline of tiny mushrooms growing, much like a fairy circle.

**Successful Skill Check**: This is not a shadow. It's a colony of responsive mold imitating a shadow. It lives in the pattern of your silhouette, animated by heat and its host's consciousness.

**Penalty:** –1 to Stealth checks (its timing is unnatural) 

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, the colony can detach and act independently for 1 minute:

- Acts like  _Mage Hand_ or _Find Familiar_ effect (floating helper or scout)
    
- Has HP equal to 1 + your level; **vulnerable to all damage types except cold and water**
    
- Can make unarmed melee attacks using your proficiency and deals 1d4+Dex+Prof, increasing by +1d4 every 5 character levels (5, 10, 15, 20)
    
- Vanishes in direct sunlight, and cannot be utilized.

**DM Note:** Build this into moments gradually. Let it act "helpful" once on its own. Let NPCs see it moving or delaying slightly _after_ the player moves. Let it gesture when the player remains still. (Can be comical)

---

### 🎲 Mutation 7 — "Fractured Eyes"

**Mutation:** Your pupils fracture like shattered obsidian, black spliting into spiderweb cracks. Over time, the optic nerve withers, your ocular muscles become lame. But something else takes over and replaces the dead nerve and atrophied muscles, allowing far better independent eye control, however in magical and natural light— everything becomes blurry reducing your vision to 20ft infront of you. Like trying to peer through steamed glass. But in darkness? You see clearly, farther and much better. If there are fungal growths in the area, you can see in a 10 foot proximity around them. 

**Penalty:** You are permanently blind in natural or magical light sources 

**Benefit:** You gain permanent darkvision up to 30 ft. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 15 ft and is enhanced to be brighter. and you can see through magical darkness. 

**DM Note:** Describe the transition over time—first light sensitivity, then headaches, then eventual blindness in magically or naturally lit areas. In darkness, their perception becomes unsettlingly crisp. Eyes may still function cosmetically, but the true vision lies in fungal sensory input.

---

### 🎲 Mutation 8 — "Echo Voice"

**Mutation:** A small rash grows into something similar to a birthmark covering your entire right cheek, it starts to leak a yellowish green ooze that seems to eat away at your flesh in an outline of the mark, the skin sloughs off in pieces revealing the decayed and mushroom gilled layer ontop of your muscle. Imperfectly creating a second proto-mouth with various misplaced teeth and growing mushroom like veins and transparent layers. It speaks, but not outwards from your cheek, rather inwards and your voice gains a strange harmonic, always slightly out of sync. Others hear two of different voices, one following the other by a few miliseconds when you speak.

**Penalty:** Disadvantage on Deception 

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, your echo mimics any phrase it hears, perfectly, as if cast from _Major Image_ (auditory only). Plus +1 to deception.

**DM Note:** Let this creep in gradually. Have NPCs ask, "Did someone just say that twice?"

---

### 🎲 Mutation 9 — "Threadblood"

**Mutation:** Whenever you take critical damage, your body stops the natural process of healing, instead your body does away with your damaged extremity and ultra-fine threadlike fibers of various dull mold colors extrude out and closing them in hurried lattice patterns to reform the part that was released. The newly grown part is a rough copy, never truly matching the original.  

**Penalty:** –1 to Constitution saving throws 

**Benefit:** Resistance to bludgeoning damage from non-magical sources **DM Note:** Let this appear after they take damage. Describe the healing as eerie, efficient, and wrong.

---

### 🎲 Mutation 10— **Veinrot** (Better description needed)

**Mutation:** Veins and muscular threads begin to darken and shift. Underneath your skin, they reroute — subtle at first, then unmistakable. The color turns deep violet. Fungus replaces function.  

**Penalty:** –1 to Strength checks  

**Benefit:** You can stretch or contort in ways that bypass mundane restraints. Gain advantage on checks to escape grapples, bindings, or tight spaces.  

**DM Note:** Focus on body tension — the muscle mass stays, but the strength feels... borrowed. Let other characters notice movement that looks almost boneless.

---

### ZUGUSDEIT 🎲 Mutation 11 — "Spore Cone" 

**Mutation:** When exposed to focused light or magical illumination, spores clinging to your skin shimmer faintly — and shift. Wherever you are, your presence emits something unseen but _felt_. People nearby tend to complain about being short of breath as if reacting to a sickness in the air. 

**Penalty:** –1 to Constitution saves 

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, exhale a 10 ft. cone of spore-heavy breath. All living creatures within the cone have Disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.  

**DM Note:** Begin with animals backing away, or NPCs coughing when nearby. Let the players notice their posture always reorients toward heat or heartbeats. Rename: **Lure Bloom**

---

### 🎲 Mutation 12 — "Rib Knife"

**Mutation:** One rib migrates silently beneath your skin, threading itself toward your dominant arm. Without pain or effort, it shifts position overnight. When needed, it emerges smoothly from the center of your palm like a curling blade of bone. It pulses once, ready. 

**Penalty:** –1 to Constitution checks 

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, you may produce and throw this rib (counts as a thrown dagger, regrows and repositions overnight). **DM Note:** Let them discover it in their sleep. They wake up to find a faint scar in their palm, and a soft throbbing in their chest where the rib used to be.

### ~~Zugusdeit  🎲 Mutation 13 — **Bloomdrift~~

Mutation - Bloomdrift: Your throat aches. Swells. Then tightens. Small ruptures bloom at the base of my neck and across the underside of my jaw — thin, split blisters that never fully heal. From them, and from my now-distended throat, you exhale a sickly-sweet plume of barely visible spores.

 These spores drift on unseen air currents, always toward the nearest uninfected living thing. Sometimes you notice it in a conversation — people cough more often around you. Animals won’t come near.

 Penalty:* -2 to Medicine Checks
 Benefit:* You gain advantage on Insight and Stealth Perception checks when within 20 ft of a living creature, as your breath particulate actively seeks out creatures, distracting them and being breathed in.

~~**DM Note:**~~

- ~~Don’t describe this as magical. It’s fungal behavior. Cellular memory reaching out.~~
    
- ~~If examined, the throat and jaw are soft and damp. The ruptures pulse slightly when the PC is angry, excited, or breathless.~~
    
- ~~Let NPCs describe “feeling weird” or “light-headed” after standing near the PC too long.~~
---
### 🎲 Mutation 14 — **Choking Cluster**

**Mutation:** A grotesque hole opens on your side where skin has sloughed off, revealing ribs that have been cracked and bent outward. Behind them, your left lung shivers — shriveled and bruised, squeezed rhythmically by cords of fungal tissue and streaks of glistening mold. From this warped cavity, puffball mushrooms slowly grow, feeding from your breath.  

**Penalty:** Disadvantage on Stealth checks.

**Benefit:** Three times per long rest, you may remove one of the lung-grown puffballs and throw it as a ranged attack (20/60 ft). On impact, it bursts in a toxic cloud: creatures in a 10 ft radius must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 poison damage and gain (gain 1 1d6 roll of infection)

**DM Note:** Introduce this slowly — shortness of breath, then a sharp ache. Maybe a PC notices the strange rhythm of their own breathing. Let them feel the puffballs squirm when touched. The first thrown grenade should feel satisfying and revolting — a mix of relief and dread.

---
### 🎲 Mutation 15 — **Frillroot**

**Mutation:** A collar of rootlike tendrils erupts from just beneath the surface of your neck, coiling tightly like a fungal noose. It quivers in rhythm with your pulse and shifts in directionless twitching when others speak too softly. When danger is near, the roots dig subtly into your skin, tugging your head toward the threat — not gently, but like a puppet’s strings twitching under command.  
**Penalty:** –1 to Perception checks while in direct daylight  
**Benefit:** Once per long rest, you automatically succeed on a passive Perception check to avoid being surprised. This applies even when unconscious or asleep, as the tendrils react instinctively.  
**DM Note:** Let this mutate slowly — sudden moments where the PC’s head jerks without reason. A tapping, like someone drumming fingers under the skin. At first, it’s subtle. But when the danger is real, describe it yanking theiwr vision sharply in place — their body reacting before they can process.

### 🎲 Mutation 16 — **Terrarium Eyes**

**Mutation:** Your eyes hollow into translucent orbs, like sealed terrariums. Mist swirls within them — pale, fungal tendrils unfurling across miniature, shifting terrain. You see shapes move in that mist when no one else does. Twice per long rest (once per eye), you may painfully extract an eye and throw it up to 30 feet. Upon impact, it cracks open, releasing spores and rapidly generating a dense web of mycelial membrane across a 10 ft area.  

**Penalty:** While missing one eye, you suffer disadvantage on ranged attacks and –2 to Perception checks. If both are missing, gain **blindsight 20 ft**, but suffer **disadvantage in direct sunlight** until a short rest, at which point the eyes regrow. During this time, slick tendrils and a thick membrane lattice visibly over your sockets.  

**Benefit:** The spread mycelium functions like the _Web_ spell, but does not require concentration. Additionally, once per use, you may see through the generated growth as though using _Clairvoyance_ (sight only) from the eye’s original location for 1 minute.  

**DM Note:** Build up with visual distortion — cloudy vision, hallucinated depth. Extraction should be viscerally described — no pain, but a feeling of immense pressure released, as if the eye wanted out. The regrowing process is grotesque and alien, with the sockets pulsing and molding the new eyes over the course of the short rest.

### 🎲 Mutation 17  — **Pore Nurse**

**Mutation:** Your skin roughens. Pores widen and darken, each surrounded by small fungal whorls that twitch when others exhale nearby. Beneath them lie twitching nodules of soft, swollen tissue that pulse with stolen vitality. If you try with a bit of effort you feel you could pull one out.. 

**Penalty:** –1 to Medicine and Survival checks  

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, you may pluck up to 5 nodes from your skin, leaving behind a gaping yet smaller hole where it once rested.  The node resembles the cap of a small mushroom, and is edible. Upon consumption you may regain 2d4 + your Constitution modifier HP.  The nodes regrow after the long rest. 

**DM Note:** Describe this as horrifyingly nurturing — like your pores have grown larger, with something hard that can be visibly seen in the pore, and the act of chewing one feels like a warm, gooey strawberry with jelly filling.  The healing effect should be disturbing, especially when enemies benefit from it too. When the pore is plucked a smell lingers, some where between rotting leaves and honey.

### 🎲 Mutation 18 — **Deaths Garden**

**Mutation:** Clusters of miniature wildflowers and pale mushrooms sprout from the corners of your eyes, weaving through your tear ducts and into your cheeks. They bloom during sorrow and pulse when near death.  
**Penalty:** –1 to Insight and Charisma checks  
**Benefit:** You can detect surface-level thoughts (as _Detect Thoughts_, no concentration) from creatures within 10 ft once per long rest. Additionally, if near a corpse, you may ask it one question as per _Speak with Dead_ (no components).  
**DM Note:** Emotional states trigger the bloom — especially grief or nostalgia. Describe their reaction to laughter and tears alike.

---

### 🎲 Mutation 19 — **Spinevine**

**Mutation:** A second segmented spine erupts along your vertebrae — thin and glossy with a corded sheath of mycelium. It can uncoil and extend, tearing skin if pushed too far.  
**Penalty:** If you elongate fully, make a DC 14 Constitution save. On failure, take 1d10 damage. On success, take half.  
**Benefit:** Once per long rest, extend your spine to double your reach vertically or horizontally for one action. It can also act like _Thorn Whip_ (1d6, 30 ft range, STR-based).  
**DM Note:** Describe movement as insectile, vertebrae clicking when extended. A wet stretch, never elegant.

---


### 🎲 Johann Mutation 20 — **Moss Lungs**

~~**Mutation:** Your throat opens slightly, revealing a secondary air slit beneath your jaw. When submerged, it pulses in rhythm with the water.~~  
~~**Penalty:** –1 to ranged attack rolls~~  
~~**Benefit:** You can breathe underwater. This opening undulates visibly and makes quiet, wet sounds when speaking.  Resistance to poison.~~ 
~~**DM Note:** Emphasize alien physiology. People notice it when they get close — an odor of damp stone and peat. You no longer feel the sticky humidity in the air. Your ability to aim is diminished by how you hold your breath differently.~~

---

.
### 🎲  HAMS Mutation 21 — **Flesh-Shed Companion** (More detail required.)

**Mutation:** A dismembered part of your body (a finger, eyeball, molars or a toe) detaches and becomes animate. It shuffles near you and mimics your motions imperfectly.  
**Penalty:** –1 to Charisma (due to the disturbing presence)  
**Benefit:** Once per long rest, it can perform a _Help_ action or interact with small objects like _Mage Hand_. If destroyed, another piece of your body replaces it during a long rest.  
**DM Note:** Let the player choose what part they lose. Encourage interaction with the piece — it has semi-awareness and memory.

---

### 🎲 JINN Mutation 22  — **Hollow Ears** (Make more detailed. )

~~**Mutation:** Your ears rot and fall off. In their place, slime mold tendrils grow and sway. Twice (for each ear cavity) per short rest, you can press your head to a surface and detect **one** hidden door or trap (choose one). The mold crawls along the surface for **50** ft.  Alternatively~~
~~**Penalty:** On single use, -2 perception checks requiring sound.  On second use become Deafened (disadvantage on perception checks) until the mold regrows (short rest).~~
~~**Benefit:** Twice per short rest use of fungal detection within the same room.~~ 
~~**DM Note:** Emphasize the horror of silence, the sudden return of a crawling auditory sensation.~~

### 🎲 Mutation 23 — **Idle Fingers**

**Mutation:** Your fingernails change colors, drying up, darkening in a yellow sickly tint before being shed, pushed out by gently undulating lattice of slime mold that extends over your fingertips, encasing them in a moist, sticky substance.

**Penalty:** -1 Dexterity or Strength checks, unable to feel what you are grasping. 
**Benefit:** Once per short rest, you may touch a surface (wall or floor) and the slim mold will rapidly extend towards a target of your choice within 35ft, entangling the target (Entangling Vines). 

---

*### Hams 🎲 Mutation 24 — **Bloomed Maw** REDO BENEFITS*

**Mutation:** Your teeth blacken and your gums split. Petals of soft fungus line your throat.  
**Penalty:** –1 to Animal Handling and Performance  
**Benefit:** Once per short rest, you may unleash a fungal bloom from your mouth, imposing Disadvantage on a target’s next melee attack.  
**DM Note:** The bloom is visible — scented like rot and flowers. Animals always recoil.

---
### 🎲 Mutation 25 — **Crown of Fallow**

**Mutation:**  
It begins with clumps. Stray strands. Then whole tufts. Over the course of a single rest, your hair sheds entirely — not in silent fall, but in _wet, fibrous sloughing_. What remains writhes.

The discarded mass pulses and folds in on itself, revealing a central fleshy core — a damp, puckered disc surrounded by tangled strands like the oral arms of a jellyfish. It twitches when touched. It breathes. And then… it _climbs_. At night, it latches onto your skull with tooth-like rootlets, embedding itself into your scalp with a sickening _pop_ and rhythmic suckling. You don’t stop it.

**Penalty:**  
–1 to all Charisma-based checks against creatures not already infected. It is plainly, deeply unnatural. Some NPCs may react with fear or aggression.

**Benefit:**  
Once per long rest, you may command the _Fallow Crown_ to detach and slither into a nearby area (30 ft). There, it roots into the ground or wall and functions as an organic scrying node. For 10 minutes, you may see and hear through it as if under the effects of _clairvoyance_.

If left for longer than 10 minutes, the Crown may begin to act independently — crawling toward warmth, light, or the scent of rot.

**DM Notes:**

- Let others notice its movement before the player does — it may twitch during conversation or shift toward loud sounds.
    
- If the PC resists its attachment, it waits. If they sleep, it returns. It _always_ returns.
    
- If destroyed, the player wakes the next morning with _stinging follicles and threads piercing through their skullcap again_. It cannot be permanently removed.

---

### ### 🎲 Mutation 26 — "Riblimb"

**Mutation:** Your ribcage no longer holds shape, your torso becoming more concave as the ribs rearrange.  One rib cracks, then another — not from trauma, but from pressure inside the bone itself. They twist and turn, shifting downwards towards your hips, then protruding outwards creating sharp bumps in a belt pattern around your circumfrence. 

When needed, they burst through the skin,  unfolding and growing long enough to act as two individual legs, thinly coated in a stretchy translucent, vein membrane of fungus and spotted areas blood clot. 

_**Penalty:** –1 to Stealth checks and Disadvantage on social interaction with commoners or children. You visibly twitch and shift with unnatural movement. **

Benefit:** Twice per day you may take a bonus action to move an additional 20 feet in any direction, including vertical surfaces. You may use these limbs to climb as though you had a Climber’s Kit, or to hang or support yourself from surfaces. 

**DM Note:**

- Introduce this mutation as painful but brief — a moment of choking pressure, a cough, then a snap like wet wood.
    
- Have NPCs react with visible discomfort. This rib-limbs should never rest calmly — it's twitchy, active, _always hunting_.
    
- Players may begin to dream of themselves scuttling on all fours, the limb taking control during sleepwalking.

---


### 🎲 Mutation 27 — **Fleeting Crown**

**Mutation:** Your skin begins sweating yellowish and green beads of thick sweat in a band that rests your entire head, the sweat never drips, but rather climbs the crown of your head in filament threads, weaving together and hardening into oyster mushrooms.

**Penalty:** Disadvantage on constitution checks, 

**Benefit:** The first melee attack against you suffers a -2 penalty to hit (temporary +2 AC bonus). The crown crumbles after absorbing the hit, regrowing after 1 long rest.

**DM Note:** This should evoke fading nobility. Something regal, half-buried. A king not long for the throne.

### 🎲 Mutation 28 — **Liars Whisper**

**Mutation:** Your tongue begins to twitch involuntarily, making speech slurred and drool pool in the corners of your mouth. Eventually, it peels itself free, painlessly forcing your teeth apart and slithering from your mouth. It hides in your hair, your pocket, or beneath your clothes. It looks rotten and veined with a soft white mycelium network, slightly glistening.  

**Penalty:** Disadvantage on speech checks.
**Benefit:** 

- Once per short rest, the tongue can perform a _Help_ action or interact with objects like _Mage Hand_.

- Nutrient Rich Environment: If it slithers across a corpse or nutrient-rich surface and returns to your mouth, it heals you for 1d4 HP once per short rest 

**DM Note:** Players will begin to notice twitches and whispers. Other NPCs should be disgusted or frightened. The tongue _wants_ to stay nearby — it hums faintly when alone.

### 🎲 Mutation 29 — "Skullbloom"

**Mutation:** Hairline fractures begin forming across your skull — painless but constant. At first, they feel like pressure headaches or sinus pain. Then, over the course of a night, the bone begins to give. Not cracking, but warping — reshaping like bark around a branch.

From the crown and rear of the skull, spongy fungal plates emerge, pressing out from beneath the bone and flesh like slowly blooming coral. The back of your head becomes uneven, pitted, soft in places. The shape subtly changes how your voice echoes inside your own mind — others begin to notice it in your speech too: a wet resonance, as if something else is speaking just behind your words. 

**Penalty:** –2 to Deception and Performance checks (speech is subtly wrong; cadence and tone are off-putting or hypnotic without intention). 


**Benefit:** You can project a disembodied voice (like _Thaumaturgy_) up to 30 ft once per short rest. In addition, once per long rest, you can emit a psychic pulse as an action — all creatures within 10 ft must succeed a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented (–1d4 on their next saving throw or ability check).

**DM Notes:**

- This mutation affects personality subtly. Describe internal echoes, reverberating thoughts, or strange words that arrive without context.
    
- NPCs with keen hearing or Insight may comment on how the PC’s voice sounds layered or _wet_.
    
- If examined, the skull fungus should resemble the porous endoskeleton of deep-sea creatures — fragile, yet clearly growing from within. **Mutation:** Your ribcage no longer holds shape. One rib cracks, then another — not from trauma, but from pressure inside. They twist outward like insect legs. By morning, a new limb unfurls from beneath your chest. It's jointed and spined, with skin stretched thin and webbed between calcified tips. It moves independently, often reacting to threats _before you do._ **Penalty:** –1 to Stealth checks and Disadvantage on social interaction with commoners or children. You visibly twitch and shift with unnatural movement. **Benefit:** Gain an additional unarmed melee attack once per short rest that deals 1d6 slashing or piercing damage (your choice each time). You may use this limb to climb as though you had a Climber’s Kit, or to hang or support yourself from vertical surfaces. **DM Note:**
    
- Introduce this mutation as painful but brief — a moment of choking pressure, a cough, then a snap like wet wood.
    
- Have NPCs react with visible discomfort. This rib-limb should never rest calmly — it's twitchy, active, _always hunting_.
    
- Players may begin to dream of themselves scuttling on all fours, the limb taking control during sleepwalking.
---

### 🎲 Mutation 30 — "Jointless"

**Mutation:** One of your limbs begins to ache — not with pain, but with heat. It grows stiff, then suddenly _too loose._ Your elbow (or knee, roll d20 to decide) seems to slide and migrate away from its natural socket,  shifting upward or downward with wet pops of cartilage.  In its place an entire new socket has formed with a new apendage, your original limb now curls unnaturally, wrapping around your torso or hanging beside another limb. 

The original limb still functions,allowing you to still utilize it with weapons,  but the new one has no joint. It extends in smooth arcs, folding like insect antennae or soft bone. It always moves second — delayed, uncertain, but _familiar._ 

**Penalty:** Disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks due to balance being disrupted. Clothing and armor must be modified to accommodate the misplaced limb.

**Benefit:** You gain an additional reaction per round, usable only to impose disadvantage on a melee attack against you or to grapple a creature within 10 ft as a reaction.

**DM Note:**

- The limb should appear wet, pale, and slightly translucent with veinlike fungal capillaries beneath the skin.
    
- It may twitch in sympathy with the PC’s emotions, reacting more like a tail or sensor array than a proper limb.
    
- Let NPCs confuse it for a growth at first. Then let them realize it moves.

---
### 🎲 Mutation 28 — "ThroatGoat"

**Mutation:** Your jaw stiffens — not with pain, but with a pulling tension that spreads down your neck. During a long rest, it unhinges and migrates, sliding grotesquely under the skin and settling into your sternum. In its place, a fungal mass erupts and reforms into a jaw-shaped growth — not quite bone, not quite muscle. It twitches, flexes, and snaps erratically.

Over time, more fungal mouths begin forming along your throat. Teeth appear at odd angles. Some are slick and smooth like river stones, others jagged like broken glass. Soon, your entire neck becomes a nest of malformed jaws, murmuring and clicking even when you are silent.

**Penalty:** –1 to Persuasion checks, and Disadvantage on Disguise attempts — your appearance is disturbing even when covered.

**Benefit:** You gain a bite attack (1d6 piercing) as a bonus action against creatures you are grappling or that are prone. Once per long rest, you may release a psychic scream from all mouths — all creatures within 15 ft must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage and be deafened for 1 minute.

**DM Note:**

- The mouths may move independently. NPCs might see them whispering to themselves.
    
- The psychic scream should feel like multiple voices all overlapping — childhood memories, unfamiliar languages, even the PC’s own voice distorted.
    
- Allow the PC to use flavor like feeding through the chest-mouth, or muffled speech due to throats full of misplaced molars.

### Mutation 31 — "Triproot"

**Mutation:** Deep within your thigh or calf, pressure builds — a pulsing, dull ache that won’t leave. Then, without injury or pain, the femur splits. Slowly, it arcs outward. A third leg begins to form — not fully humanoid, but twisted like a spider’s. The joint bends in a new direction. Skin grows tight over it like stretched fungus membrane.

This new leg juts from the side or rear of your leg, moving only when needed. It sometimes reacts to balance shifts before you do. It may twitch when you lie or flinch when startled.

**Penalty:** You move with an unnatural gait. –1 to Stealth checks. Certain NPCs may treat you with fear or revulsion.

**Benefit:** As a bonus action once per long rest, you may activate _Triproot_ to gain:

- **Double jump height** and **advantage on checks to climb or leap** for 10 minutes.
    
- **Thornwhip** once per long rest, flavored as the leg stretching unnaturally to lash out.
    

**If you attempt to fully extend or compress the leg (to reach high ledges or narrow spaces):** Roll a DC 14 Constitution save. On a failure, you take 1d10 bludgeoning damage as your skin tears around the bone. On a success, take half.

**DM Notes:**

- When unused, the leg folds in tightly, like an insect limb curled beneath the flesh.
    
- It may “kick” when asleep, or react autonomously to sudden loud sounds.
    
- Let NPCs interpret this as monstrous, cryptid, or mutation-adjacent. It should never feel graceful — always like something borrowed.

### 🎲  Mutation 32  — "Spore Sieve"

**Mutation:** Your skin takes on a slick, pitted texture around the chest and shoulders. It begins to dry and thin in places — not cracking, but receding. Underneath, open-pore lattices of mycelial filters reveal themselves. The tissue beneath constantly shifts and pulses like breathing gills.

Occasionally, the pores throb and release a short, rapid wheeze of spore gas. It doesn’t hurt — it feels like a hiccup. When stressed or bleeding, the pores vent involuntarily.

**Penalty:** –1 to all saving throws against being frightened or charmed. The shifting spores alter your emotional baseline, making you more permeable to influence.

**Benefit:** Once per long rest, you may choose to release a controlled spore burst. Any creature in a 20 ft radius with at least 1 Infection Tally is affected as if by _Healing Word_ at 1st level. This includes enemies. Gain resistance to poison as a passive benefit. 

**DM Notes:**

- The pores are visible and slightly iridescent under light. In darkness, they emit faint heat.
    
- When used, describe a low, rhythmic thrumming from the mutation — almost like a heartbeat, but not synced to the player’s own.
    
- This ability is less about choice and more like a parasitic adaptation — the colony heals its own, even when it’s inconvenient to the host.
