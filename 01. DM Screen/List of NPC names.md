- [ ] **Harwin Dunn – Human Wizard** (Paranoid Local)  
      Hair wild, robes too tight. Convinced birds are watching him. Not wrong.

      Deep scars across his arms and a moon-shaped medallion. Tends wounds better than he talks.

      Smudged hands, wide grin. Constantly chewing licorice root and “finding” dropped items.

      Ragged hat, three-stringed lute, changes stories every time he tells them.

      Deer-hide cloak, snow-dusted hair, barely speaks above a whisper.

      Mimics perfectly but never speaks for itself. Carries a cracked bell.

      Pale and silent, her eyes don’t blink. She claims to “know who’s buried here.”

      Moss-covered shell. Once killed a basilisk with a stick, doesn’t like to brag.

- [ ] **Kelna of the Shifting Sand – Air Genasi Sorcerer** (Nomad)  
      Her cloak swirls without wind. She’s always “just passing through.”

      Stained gloves and a satchel of weird tools. Always testing something new.

      Grey-furred, sings lies sweeter than truths and prefers it that way.

      Stoic and blue-scaled. Never draws her weapon unless honor demands it.

      Smells like salt and fish guts. Talks to the sky like it answers back.

      Gold tattoos glow faintly under her robes. Preaches kindness… but never mercy.
