- What motivates them to *keep going*? (.... sexy pigs...?)

## 🔹 4. BATON PASS (0:40–1:00)

## 🎤 One-on-One Baton-Pass Prep — DM Guide

> Use this 5-minute private moment during Session 0 with each player to:
> 
> - Lock in how they’ll describe their character during their intro
>     
> - Help them anchor the moment of trust they’ll recall about another PC
>     
> - Prep them to hand off the baton naturally
>     

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Character Description Prep

Start with this:

> **“In a few lines, I want you to be ready to describe how your character looks like if someone were to be looking at them in a tavern. Use mood. Posture. Movement. Weathered detail.”**

**Pull from 2024 Background Descriptors:**  
Here’s a prompt list they can pick from or use as inspiration: (Answer as the character, not as the player)

- What is the first thing someone would notice about you?
    
- What about your clothes, gear, or bearing shows who you _used_ to be?
    
- What sound do your footsteps make when walking down a gravel road?
    
- What smell follows you?
    
- Do you think you would stick close to someone when entering a dungeon hallway you've never explored before? Would you take charge, or walk two abreast?  Perhaps you'd guard the rear or hang back in the previous room until all is clear?
    
- What are you doing with your hands while walking?
    
- How do you feel about silence? When noone is talking, do you pipe up? How do you do it?
    

**🪶 Rollable Table (d8):**  
(For stuck players – roll once or twice for inspiration)

|d8|Detail Hook|
|---|---|
|1|You wear something that belonged to someone who saved you.|
|2|You walk like someone used to riding — straight back, light step.|
|3|You keep one hand near your belt pouch at all times. Why?|
|4|Your cloak still smells faintly of smoke — but not campfire.|
|5|You look exhausted, but no one’s seen you sleep deeply.|
|6|You have a habit of scanning the trees like you expect trouble.|
|7|You hum under your breath when nervous. You’re humming now.|
|8|Something about you makes children curious. Or afraid.|

### 🔹 Step 2: Anchor the Memory of Trust

> **“Now think about the moment your character knew they could trust Next Player’s Character.”**

It can be light, tense, tragic, funny — whatever tone feels right.

If they struggle, ask:

- Was it a fight? (Were you back-to-back or nearly dead?)
    
- Did they take a hit for you?
    
- Did they say something that cut through your defenses?
    
- Was it something clever or ridiculous they did that broke tension?
    
- Did they help you lie to someone? Save you from yourself?
    

> **“This will be used at some point. Its important that your character has this memory. It may come up, so be sure you tell this story if it comes around”**

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Record It

Write down:

- One bullet for how they’ll describe themselves
    
- One bullet summarizing the moment of trust
    

Use this to guide the opening narration of that player’s baton scene.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Pass the Baton

After Player A finishes describing the memory of Player B’s character, immediately shift focus:

> “And as the memory fades, your eyes fall on Player B’s Name, walking just ahead of you…”

That’s Player B’s cue to describe their appearance and start their own memory of Player C — and so on.

---

### 🔚 Final Step: Closing the Loop

The last player’s memory can be of:

- The moment the group worked together seamlessly
    
- A shared victory or loss
    
- Something that made them realize: _this is a real adventuring party now_
    

> “The moment that cemented the group, even if none of you ever said it out loud.”

### While Others Wait:
- Flesh out bond text
- Practice or describe character voice
- Light in-character mingling
