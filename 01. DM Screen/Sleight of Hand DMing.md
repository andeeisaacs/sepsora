# Some very interesting ideas for DMing your way through a campaign!

## Lore Episodes / Campfire Episodes
	Or how we deal with traveling, missing players and backstory.
	
Create mini-encounters in easy 5-15 minute flash-backs of specific PC background stories, and create a tiny Look at each PC's backstory and find something interesting in it, ask the PC ahead of time about specifics such as Enemies (Or NPCs if not a combat encounter, although combat works the best for these) and relevant items. During this time prepare the backstory episode enemy combatant character sheets, making sure the enemies can be defeated and hand them to the other players. Rewards can be how the player got a specific item from their past, or how they survived an attack, etc etc. Something that tells the story of the character.

### Things to keep in mind
- Prepare these ahead of time. Preferably way before session 1, so that you can bust them out if the players do something that you werent prepared for, etc.
- Take time to ask the PC's specifics about their backstory.
- These mini-episodes can happen during the beginning of every session, or any time the players have the opportunity to do a long rest or are traveling.

## Character Questions

- What does your character look/sound/smell like?
- How/Why did they become an adventurer?
- Where are they from? Why aren’t they there now?
- How did they become their class?
- What’s the first thing people notice about them?
